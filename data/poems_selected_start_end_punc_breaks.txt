endlinehere startlinehere shafts of broken sunlight lineendhere dissolving convolutions lineendhere of torpid cloud . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the boat drifts to lineendhere rest under the outward lineendhere spraying branches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is an iris , dark lineendhere purple , pale rose , under the gnarled boughs that lineendhere shatter their stars of bloom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she waves lineendhere delicately with the movement lineendhere of the tree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of what lineendhere is she lineendhere dreaming? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of long nights lit with orange lineendhere lanterns , of wine cups and compliments and lineendhere kisses of the two -- sword men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and of dawn when weary sleepers lie lineendhere outstretched on the mats of the palace , and of the iris lineendhere stalk that is broken in the fountain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere autumn winds roll through the lineendhere dry leaves on her garments; autumn lineendhere birds shiver athwart star -- hung skies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere under the blossoming plum -- tree , she expresses lineendhere the pilgrimage of grey souls passing , athwart love's scarlet lineendhere maples to the ash -- strewn summit of death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere iris -- amid -- clouds lineendhere must be lineendhere her name . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tall and lonely lineendhere as the mountain -- iris , lineendhere cold and distant . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she has never known lineendhere longing: many have died lineendhere for love of her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he listens idly , lineendhere he is content lineendhere with her voice . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are spotted with lineendhere thunder showers , falling upon lineendhere the crimson petals . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is a fierce kitten lineendhere leaping in sunlight towards lineendhere the swaying boughs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is a gust of wind , bending lineendhere in parallel curves the boughs lineendhere of the willow -- tree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gilded hummingbirds are whizzing lineendhere through the palace garden , deceived by the jade lineendhere petals of the emperor's jewel -- trees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wind half blows lineendhere her robes , that subside listlessly lineendhere as swaying pines . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wind tosses hers in circles lineendhere that recoil upon themselves: how should i lineendhere love -- as the swaying or tossing wind? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she glances expectantly lineendhere through the pine avenue , to the cherry -- tree summit lineendhere where her lover will appear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gold and lineendhere vermilion the lineendhere afternoon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wait here dreaming of vermilion lineendhere sunsets: in my heart is a half fear lineendhere of the chill autumn rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the daimyo lineendhere and the courtesan compliment lineendhere each other . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he invites her to walk lineendhere out through the maples , she half refuses , lineendhere hiding fear in her heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is like the great lineendhere rains that fall over the lineendhere earth in winter -- time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gaily he lineendhere offers packets lineendhere of merchandise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is a harlequin of lineendhere illusions , his nimble features skip into smiles , lineendhere like rainbows , cheating the villagers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but in his heart all the while is lineendhere another knowledge , the sorrow of the bleakness lineendhere of the long wet winter night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one life is a long summer; tall lineendhere hollyhocks stand proud upon its paths; little yellow lineendhere waves of sunlight , bring scarlet butterflies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere another life is a brief autumn , fierce lineendhere storm -- rack scrawled with lightning passed over it leaving the naked lineendhere bleeding earth , stabbed with the swords of the rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he plots for lineendhere he is angry , he sneers lineendhere for he is bold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he clinches his fist like a twisted lineendhere snake; coiling itself , preparing to raise its head , above lineendhere the long grasses of the plain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have forgotten how many lineendhere times he kissed me , but i cannot forget a swaying lineendhere branch -- a leaf that fell to earth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he stands irresolute lineendhere cloaking the light of lineendhere his lantern . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tonight he will either find lineendhere new love or a sword -- thrust , but his soul is lineendhere troubled with ghosts of old regret . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like vines with crimson lineendhere flowers they climb upwards lineendhere into his heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she was a dream of moons , of fluttering handkerchiefs , lineendhere of flying leaves , of parasols , a riddle made to break my heart; the lightest lineendhere impulse to her was more dear than the deep -- toned temple bell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she fluttered to my sword -- hilt an lineendhere instant , and then flew away; but who will spend lineendhere all day chasing a butterfly? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it a vision lineendhere under the lineendhere moonlight? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no , it is only lineendhere a beautiful geisha lineendhere swaying down the street . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere out of the rings and the bubbles , the curls and the lineendhere swirls of the water , out of the crystalline shower of drops shattered lineendhere in play , her body and her thoughts arose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere poems are falling from them swift as the wind lineendhere that shakes the lance -- like bamboo leaves; the stars close around like bubbles lineendhere stirred by the silver oars of poems passing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beware , for the lineendhere dying vine can hold the lineendhere strongest oak . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only by lineendhere cutting at the root can love lineendhere be altered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere late in the night a lineendhere rosy glimmer yet defies lineendhere the darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the evening is growing late , the blinds are lineendhere being lowered; she who held your heart and charmed you is only lineendhere a rosy glimmer of flame remembered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rain rattles on the pavement , puddles lineendhere stand in the bluish stones; afar in the lineendhere yoshiwara is she who holds my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alas , the torn lantern lineendhere of my hope trembles and sputters lineendhere in the rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i saw him pass at twilight; lineendhere he was a dark cloud travelling over lineendhere palace roofs with one claw drooping . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one dainty lineendhere thrust , no more than lineendhere this , he needs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his heart is like a wind torn between cloud lineendhere and butterfly; whether he will roll passively to lineendhere one , or chase endlessly the other . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my heart is broken and mournful lineendhere as rain heard beating far off in the distance lineendhere while earth is parched more near . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he only can bow to men lofty as a god lineendhere to those beneath him , who has taken sins and sorrows and whose deathless spirit lineendhere leaps beneath them like a golden carp in the torrent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the laughing rains lineendhere of spring will break the weak lineendhere green shoots of their love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his will grow a towering lineendhere stalk , hers , a cowering flower lineendhere under it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere would that the rains lineendhere of all the winters might wash lineendhere away my grief ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cranes have come back to the temple , lineendhere the winds are flapping the flags about , through a lineendhere flute of reeds i will blow a song . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere chrysanthemums lineendhere bending before the lineendhere wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere chrysanthemums lineendhere wavering in the black lineendhere choked grasses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wind frowns at them , he lineendhere tears off a green and orange stalk lineendhere of broken chrysanthemum . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the chrysanthemums spread lineendhere their flattered heads , and scurry lineendhere off before the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere storm -- birds of autumn with draggled wings: sleet -- beaten , wind -- tattered , snow -- frozen , stopping lineendhere in sheer weariness between the gnarled red pine trees twisted in doubt and lineendhere despair; whence do you come , pilgrims , over what snow fields? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to what southern province lineendhere hidden behind dim peaks , lineendhere would you go? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "too long were the telling wherefore lineendhere we set out; and where we will find rest lineendhere only the gods may tell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only beyond the still grey shoji for the lineendhere breadth of innumerable countries , is the sea with lineendhere ships asleep in the blue -- black starless night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a squall lineendhere has struck the sea lineendhere afar off . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you can feel it quiver over the paper lineendhere parasol with which she shields her face; in the drawn -- together skirts lineendhere of her robes , as she turns to meet it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere windy evening of autumn , by the lineendhere grey -- green swirling river , people are resting like still boats tugging lineendhere uneasily at their cramped chains . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere some are moving slowly like the easy winds: brown -- blue , lineendhere dull -- green , the villages in the distance sleep on the banks of the river: lineendhere the waters sullenly clash and murmur . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the chatter of the lineendhere passersby , is dulled beneath lineendhere the grey unquiet sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the green and violet peacocks through lineendhere the golden dusk showered upon them from the vine -- hung lanterns , lineendhere stately , nostalgically , parade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will scrawl lineendhere on the walls of lineendhere the night faces . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere leering , sneering , scowling , threatening faces; lineendhere weeping , twisting , yelling , howling faces; faces fixed in a contortion lineendhere between a scream and a laugh , meaningless faces . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will cover the walls of night with lineendhere faces , till you do not know if these faces lineendhere are but masks , or you the masks for them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere faces too grotesque for laughter , faces lineendhere too shattered by pain for tears , faces of such ugliness lineendhere that the ugliness grows beauty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they will haunt you morning , lineendhere evening , burning , burning , ever lineendhere returning . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their own infamy creating , lineendhere till you strike at life and hate it , burn lineendhere your soul up so in hating . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will scrawl on the lineendhere walls of the night faces , pitiless , lineendhere flaring , staring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the seasons passed for her , like lineendhere pale iris wilting , or peonies flying lineendhere to ribbons before the storm -- gusts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sombre lineendhere pine -- tops waited until lineendhere the seasons had passed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my beloved is like blue smoke that lineendhere rises in long slow planes , and wavers over the lineendhere dark paths of old gardens long neglected . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there was a city living here long ago , of lineendhere all that city there is only one stone left half -- buried in the marsh , with lineendhere characters upon it which no one now can read . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in my heart is lineendhere the sorrow of years like lineendhere red leaves buried in snow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere girls will laugh and scatter lineendhere cherry petals , sometimes they will rest lineendhere in the twisted pine -- trees' shade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if one presses her warm lips to lineendhere this tablet the dust of my body will feel a lineendhere thrill , deep down in the silent earth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sky spreads out its poor array of tattered lineendhere flags , saffron and rose over the weary huddle of housetops lineendhere smoking their evening pipes in silence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the city gleams with lights lineendhere this evening like loud and yawning lineendhere laughter from red lips . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as the fish that leaps from the river , as the dropping lineendhere of a november leaf at twilight , as the faint flicker of lightning down the lineendhere southern sky , so i saw beauty , far away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i dreamed i caught your loveliness in little lineendhere silver jars: and when you died i opened them , and lineendhere there was only soot within . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rain fell so softly , in the lineendhere evening , i almost thought it was lineendhere the trees that were talking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cities are the toy -- boxes time plays lineendhere with: and there are often many doll -- houses lineendhere of which the dolls are lost . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a poet's moods: lineendhere fluttering butterflies lineendhere in the rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grass moves in the lineendhere wind , my soul is lineendhere backwards blown . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere land , green -- brown; sea , lineendhere brown -- grey; island , dull peacock lineendhere blue; sky , stone -- grey . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a bell in the fog creeps out lineendhere echoing faintly the pale broad flashes lineendhere of vibrating twilight , faded gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is a goddess who lineendhere walks shrouded by day: at night she throws lineendhere her blue veil over the earth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere men only see her lineendhere naked glory through the little lineendhere holes in the veil . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an old courtyard lineendhere hidden away in the lineendhere afternoon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grey walks , mossy stones , copper carp swimming lineendhere lazily , and beyond , a faint toneless hissing lineendhere echo of rain that tears at my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here i am , an old man lineendhere in a dry month , being read to lineendhere by a boy , waiting for rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i was neither at the hot gates nor lineendhere fought in the warm rain nor knee deep in the salt marsh , lineendhere heaving a cutlass , bitten by flies , fought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my house is a decayed house , and the jew squats on lineendhere the window sill , the owner , spawned in some estaminet of antwerp , lineendhere blistered in brussels , patched and peeled in london . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the goat coughs at night lineendhere in the field overhead; rocks , moss , lineendhere stonecrop , iron , merds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the woman keeps the kitchen , lineendhere makes tea , sneezes at evening , poking lineendhere the peevish gutter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i an old lineendhere man , a dull head among windy lineendhere spaces . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere signs are taken lineendhere for lineendhere wonders . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "we would see a sign": the lineendhere word within a word , unable to speak lineendhere a word , swaddled with darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the juvescence of the year came christ the tiger in lineendhere depraved may , dogwood and chestnut , flowering judas , to be eaten , to be lineendhere divided , to be drunk among whispers; by mr . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere vacant lineendhere shuttles lineendhere weave the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have no ghosts , an old lineendhere man in a draughty house under lineendhere a windy knob . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere after lineendhere such knowledge , lineendhere what forgiveness? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere think now history has many cunning lineendhere passages , contrived corridors and issues , deceives with lineendhere whispering ambitions , guides us by vanities . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere think now she gives when our attention is lineendhere distracted and what she gives , gives with such supple confusions lineendhere that the giving famishes the craving . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gives too late what's not believed lineendhere in , or if still believed , in memory lineendhere only , reconsidered passion . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gives too soon into weak hands , what's lineendhere thought can be dispensed with till the lineendhere refusal propagates a fear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere think neither lineendhere fear nor courage lineendhere saves us . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere unnatural lineendhere vices are fathered by our lineendhere heroism . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these tears are lineendhere shaken from lineendhere the wrath -- bearing tree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the tiger lineendhere springs in lineendhere the new year . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere us lineendhere he lineendhere devours . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere think at last we have lineendhere not reached conclusion , when i lineendhere stiffen in a rented house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere think at last i have not made this show lineendhere purposelessly and it is not by any lineendhere concitation of the backward devils . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i would meet lineendhere you upon this lineendhere honestly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i that was near your heart was lineendhere removed therefrom to lose beauty in terror , lineendhere terror in inquisition . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have lost my passion: why lineendhere should i need to keep it since what is kept lineendhere must be adulterated? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have lost my sight , smell , lineendhere hearing , taste and touch: how should i use lineendhere it for your closer contact? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these with a thousand small deliberations protract the profit lineendhere of their chilled delirium , excite the membrane , when the sense has cooled , with pungent sauces , lineendhere multiply variety in a wilderness of mirrors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what will the spider do , lineendhere suspend its operations , will lineendhere the weevil delay? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere de bailhache , lineendhere fresca , lineendhere mrs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cammel , whirled beyond the lineendhere circuit of the shuddering bear lineendhere in fractured atoms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tenants of the house , lineendhere thoughts of a dry brain in lineendhere a dry season . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- so the countess passed on until she lineendhere came through the little park , where niobe presented her lineendhere with a cabinet , and so departed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere burbank crossed a little bridge lineendhere descending at a small hotel; princess volupine lineendhere arrived , they were together , and he fell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere defunctive music under sea passed lineendhere seaward with the passing bell slowly: the god lineendhere hercules had left him , that had loved him well . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the horses , under the lineendhere axletree beat up the dawn from lineendhere istria with even feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her shuttered barge lineendhere burned on the water lineendhere all the day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but this or such was bleistein's way: a lineendhere saggy bending of the knees and elbows , with the palms lineendhere turned out , chicago semite viennese . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the smoky lineendhere candle end of time lineendhere declines . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the lineendhere rialto lineendhere once . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rats are lineendhere underneath lineendhere the piles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the jew lineendhere is underneath lineendhere the lot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lights , lights , she lineendhere entertains sir lineendhere ferdinand klein . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who clipped the lion's lineendhere wings and flea'd his rump and lineendhere pared his claws? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thought burbank , lineendhere meditating on time's lineendhere ruins , and the seven laws . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the trees about me , let them be dry lineendhere and leafless; let the rocks groan with continual surges; lineendhere and behind me make all a desolation . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere look , lineendhere look , lineendhere wenches ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paint me a cavernous waste shore cast in lineendhere the unstilted cyclades , paint me the bold anfractuous lineendhere rocks faced by the snarled and yelping seas . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere display me aeolus above lineendhere reviewing the insurgent gales which tangle ariadne's lineendhere hair and swell with haste the perjured sails . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere morning stirs the feet and hands lineendhere (nausicaa and polypheme), gesture of orang -- outang lineendhere rises from the sheets in steam . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sweeney addressed full length to shave lineendhere broadbottomed , pink from nape to base , knows the female lineendhere temperament and wipes the suds around his face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (the lengthened shadow of a man is history , lineendhere said emerson who had not seen the silhouette lineendhere of sweeney straddled in the sun). lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tests the razor lineendhere on his leg waiting until lineendhere the shriek subsides . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the epileptic lineendhere on the bed curves backward , clutching lineendhere at her sides . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the ladies of the corridor find themselves involved , disgraced , call lineendhere witness to their principles and deprecate the lack of taste observing that lineendhere hysteria might easily be misunderstood; mrs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere turner intimates lineendhere it does the house no lineendhere sort of good . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but doris , towelled from the bath , enters lineendhere padding on broad feet , bringing sal volatile lineendhere and a glass of brandy neat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere pipit sate upright in her chair some distance lineendhere from where i was sitting; views of the oxford colleges lineendhere lay on the table , with the knitting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere daguerreotypes and silhouettes , lineendhere her grandfather and great great aunts , supported on the lineendhere mantelpiece an invitation to the dance . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall not want honour in heaven for lineendhere i shall meet sir philip sidney and have talk with lineendhere coriolanus and other heroes of that kidney . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall not want capital in heaven for lineendhere i shall meet sir alfred mond: we two shall lie together , lineendhere lapt in a five per cent exchequer bond . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall not want society in heaven , lucretia lineendhere borgia shall be my bride; her anecdotes will be more amusing lineendhere than pipit's experience could provide . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but where is the penny lineendhere world i bought to eat with pipit lineendhere behind the screen? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the red -- eyed scavengers are creeping lineendhere from kentish town and golder's green; where are lineendhere the eagles and the trumpets? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere buried lineendhere beneath some lineendhere snow -- deep alps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over buttered scones and lineendhere crumpets weeping , weeping multitudes lineendhere droop in a hundred a . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 's ["abc's" signifes lineendhere endemic teashops , found lineendhere in all parts of london . lineendhere

startlinehere the broad -- backed hippopotamus rests on lineendhere his belly in the mud; although he seems so firm lineendhere to us he is merely flesh and blood . lineendhere endlinehere

startlinehere the hippo's feeble steps may err in lineendhere compassing material ends , while the true church need never lineendhere stir to gather in its dividends . lineendhere endlinehere

day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so fine a show was never seen at lineendhere the great circus on the green; for every kind lineendhere beast and man is marching in that caravan .

lineendhere trees and houses smaller grow; last , round the woody lineendhere turn we swing: good -- bye , good -- bye , to everything ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i was sick and lay a -- bed , i had lineendhere two pillows at my head , and all my toys beside me lineendhere lay to keep me happy all the day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and sometimes for an hour or so lineendhere i watched my leaden soldiers go , with different lineendhere uniforms and drills , among the bed -- clothes , through the hills . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and sometimes sent

down the river , a lineendhere hundred miles or more , other little lineendhere children shall bring my boats ashore . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through all the pleasant meadow -- side lineendhere the grass grew shoulder -- high , till the shining scythes went far and lineendhere wide and cut it down to dry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these green and sweetly smelling crops lineendhere they led in wagons home; and they piled them here lineendhere in mountain -- tops for mountaineers to roam . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here is mount clear , mount rusty -- nail , mount eagle lineendhere and mount high; -- the mice that in these mountains dwell , lineendhere no happier are than i ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o what a joy to clamber there , lineendhere o what a place for play , with the sweet , the dim , the lineendhere dusty air , the happy hills of hay ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whenever auntie lineendhere moves around her dresses make lineendhere a curious sound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they trail behind lineendhere her up the floor , and trundle lineendhere after through the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the friendly cow all red and white , lineendhere i love with all my heart: she gives me cream with all lineendhere her might , to eat with apple -- tart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she wanders lowing here and there , and lineendhere yet she cannot stray , all in the pleasant open lineendhere air , the pleasant light of day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and blown by all the winds that pass lineendhere and wet with all the showers , she walks among the lineendhere meadow grass and eats the meadow flowers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere up into the lineendhere cherry tree who should climb lineendhere but little me? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i held the trunk lineendhere with both my hands and looked abroad lineendhere on foreign lands . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i saw the next door garden lie , adorned lineendhere with flowers , before my eye , and many pleasant places lineendhere more that i had never seen before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i saw the dimpling river pass and lineendhere be the sky's blue looking -- glass; the dusty roads go up lineendhere and down with people tramping into town . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if i could find a higher tree farther lineendhere and farther i should see , to where the grown -- up river slips lineendhere into the sea among the ships . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to where the roads on either hand lead lineendhere onward into fairy land , where all the children dine lineendhere at five , and all the playthings come alive . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere every night my prayers i say , and lineendhere get my dinner every day; and every lineendhere day that i've been good i get an orange after food . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the child that is not clean and neat , with lineendhere lots of toys and things to eat , he is a naughty child , i'm lineendhere sure -- or else his dear papa is poor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my holes were hollow like a lineendhere cup , in every hole the sea came lineendhere up , till it could hold no more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all by myself i have to go , with lineendhere none to tell me what to do -- all alone beside lineendhere the streams and up the mountain -- sides of dreams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the strangest things are there for me , both lineendhere things to eat and things to see , and many frightening lineendhere sights abroad till morning in the land of nod . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere try as i like to find the way , i lineendhere never can get back by day , nor can remember plain and lineendhere clear the curious music that i hear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whenever the moon and stars are lineendhere set , whenever the wind is high , all night long in the lineendhere dark and wet , a man goes riding by . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere late in the night when the lineendhere fires are out , why does he gallop lineendhere and gallop about? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whenever the trees are crying aloud , lineendhere and ships are tossed at sea , by , on the highway , low lineendhere and loud , by at the gallop goes he . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by at the gallop he lineendhere goes , and then by he comes back at lineendhere the gallop again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a birdie with a yellow bill hopped lineendhere up on the window sill , cocked his shining eye lineendhere and said: 'ain't you 'shamed , you sleepy -- head? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ' the rain is lineendhere raining all lineendhere around . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it falls on field and lineendhere tree , it rains on the umbrellas here , lineendhere and on the ships at sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere little indian , sioux lineendhere or crow , little frosty eskimo , little lineendhere turk or japanee , o ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere don't you wish lineendhere that you lineendhere were me? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you have seen the scarlet trees and the lineendhere lions over seas; you have eaten ostrich eggs , lineendhere and turned the turtles off their legs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such a life is very fine , but it's lineendhere not so nice as mine: you must often , as you trod , lineendhere have wearied _not_ to be abroad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you have curious things to eat , lineendhere i am fed on proper meat; you must dwell beyond lineendhere the foam , but i am safe and live at home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i am grown to man's estate lineendhere i shall be very proud and great , and tell the other lineendhere girls and boys not to meddle with my toys . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have a little shadow that lineendhere goes in and out with me , and what can be the lineendhere use of him is more than i can see . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is very , very like me , from lineendhere the heels up to the head; and i see him jump before lineendhere me , when i jump into my bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he hasn't got a notion of how lineendhere children ought to play , and can only make a lineendhere fool of me in every sort of way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he stays so close beside me , he's a coward lineendhere you can see; i'd think shame to stick to nursie lineendhere as that shadow sticks to me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun is not a -- bed when i at night lineendhere upon my pillow lie; still round the earth his way lineendhere he takes , and morning after morning makes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while here at home in shining day , we round lineendhere the sunny garden play , each little indian sleepy -- head lineendhere is being kissed and put to bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and when at eve i rise from tea , day dawns lineendhere beyond the atlantic sea; and all the children in the lineendhere west are getting up and being dressed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere smooth it slides upon lineendhere its travel , here a wimple , there a gleam -- lineendhere o the clean gravel ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o the lineendhere smooth lineendhere stream ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sailing blossoms , silver fishes , lineendhere paven pools as clear as air -- how a lineendhere child wishes to live down there ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see the rings pursue each other; lineendhere all below grows black as night , just as if mother lineendhere had blown out the light ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere patience , children , just a minute -- lineendhere see the spreading circles die; the stream lineendhere and all in it will clear by -- and -- by . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of speckled eggs the birdie sings lineendhere and nests among the trees; the sailor sings of lineendhere ropes and things in ships upon the seas . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the children sing in far japan , the lineendhere children sing in spain; the organ with the organ lineendhere man is singing in the rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my bed is like a little boat; lineendhere nurse helps me in when i embark; she girds me in lineendhere my sailor's coat and starts me in the dark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at night , i go on board and say good lineendhere night to all my friends on shore; i shut my eyes and sail lineendhere away and see and hear no more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and sometimes things to bed i take , as lineendhere prudent sailors have to do; perhaps a slice lineendhere of wedding -- cake , perhaps a toy or two . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all night across the dark we steer: but lineendhere when the day returns at last safe in my room , beside lineendhere the pier , i find my vessel fast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over the borders , a sin without pardon , breaking lineendhere the branches and crawling below , out through the breach in the wall of the lineendhere garden , down by the banks of the river , we go . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here is the mill with the humming of thunder , here is lineendhere the weir with the wonder of foam , here is the sluice with the race running lineendhere under -- marvelous places , though handy to home ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere years may go by , and the lineendhere wheel in the river wheel as it wheels lineendhere for us , children , to -- day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wheel and keep roaring and lineendhere foaming for ever long after lineendhere all of the boys are away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere home from the indies and home from the ocean , heroes lineendhere and soldiers we all shall come home; still we shall find the old mill wheel in lineendhere motion , turning and churning that river to foam . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you with the bean that i gave when we quarreled , i lineendhere with your marble of saturday last , honored and old and all gaily lineendhere apparelled , here we shall meet and remember the past . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when children are playing alone lineendhere on the green , in comes the playmate lineendhere that never was seen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when children are happy and lineendhere lonely and good , the friend of the children lineendhere comes out of the wood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nobody heard him and nobody saw , his is a lineendhere picture you never could draw , but he's sure to be present , abroad or at lineendhere home , when children are happy and playing alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i saw you toss the kites on high and blow the lineendhere birds about the sky; and all around i heard you pass , like ladies' lineendhere skirts across the grass -- o wind , a -- blowing all day long ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o wind , lineendhere that sings so lineendhere loud a song ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i saw the different lineendhere things you did , but always you lineendhere yourself you hid . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i felt you push , i heard you call , lineendhere i could not see yourself at all -- o wind , a -- blowing all day lineendhere long , o wind , that sings so loud a song ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o you that are so lineendhere strong and cold , o blower , lineendhere are you young or old? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere are you a beast of lineendhere field and tree , or just a stronger lineendhere child than me? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o wind , a -- blowing all lineendhere day long , o wind , that sings lineendhere so loud a song ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i woke before the morning , i lineendhere was happy all the day , i never said an ugly lineendhere word , but smiled and stuck to play . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and now at last the sun is going lineendhere down behind the wood , and i am very lineendhere happy , for i know that i've been good . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my bed is waiting cool and fresh , lineendhere with linen smooth and fair , and i must off to lineendhere sleepsin -- by , and not forget my prayer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i know that , till to -- morrow i shall see the lineendhere sun arise , no ugly dream shall fright my lineendhere mind , no ugly sight my eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but slumber hold me tightly , till lineendhere i waken in the dawn , and hear the thrushes lineendhere singing in the lilacs round the lawn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere children , you are very little , and lineendhere your bones are very brittle; if you would grow great and stately , lineendhere you must try to walk sedately . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you must still be bright and quiet , and content lineendhere with simple diet; and remain , through all bewild'ring , lineendhere innocent and honest children . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere happy hearts and happy faces , happy lineendhere play in grassy places -- that was how , in ancient ages , lineendhere children grew to kings and sages . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the unkind and the unruly , and lineendhere the sort who eat unduly , they must never hope for lineendhere glory -- theirs is quite a different story ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cruel children , crying babies , all grow lineendhere up as geese and gabies , hated , as their age lineendhere increases , by their nephews and their nieces . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere summer fading , winter comes -- frosty lineendhere mornings , tingling thumbs , window robins , winter lineendhere rooks , and the picture story -- books . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere water now is turned to stone lineendhere nurse and i can walk upon; still we find the lineendhere flowing brooks in the picture story -- books . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all the pretty things put by lineendhere wait upon the childrens' eye , sheep and shepherds , trees and lineendhere crooks , in the picture story -- books . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we may see how all things are , lineendhere seas and cities , near and far , and the flying fairies' lineendhere looks , in the picture story -- books . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how am i to sing your lineendhere praise , happy chimney -- corner days , sitting safe in lineendhere nursery nooks , reading picture story -- books? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how do you like to lineendhere go up in a swing , up in lineendhere the air so blue? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , i do think it the lineendhere pleasantest thing ever lineendhere a child can do ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is very nice to think the world lineendhere is full of meat and drink with little children saying lineendhere grace in every christian kind of place . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lamps now glitter down the street; faintly lineendhere sound the falling feet and the blue even slowly lineendhere falls about the garden trees and walls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now in the falling of the gloom the lineendhere red fire paints the empty room; and warmly on the roof lineendhere it looks , and flickers on the backs of books . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere armies march by tower and spire of lineendhere cities blazing , in the fire; -- till as i gaze with staring lineendhere eyes , the armies fade , the lustre dies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then once again the glow returns; lineendhere again the phantom city burns; and down lineendhere the red -- hot valley , lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the phantom lineendhere armies marching lineendhere go ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blinking embers , tell me true where are lineendhere those armies marching to , and what the burning city lineendhere is that crumbles in your furnaces ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down by a shining water lineendhere well i found a very little dell , no lineendhere higher than my head . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the heather and the gorse lineendhere about in summer bloom were coming out , lineendhere some yellow and some red . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i called the little pool a lineendhere sea; the little hills were big to me; lineendhere for i am very small . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i made a boat , i made lineendhere a town , i searched the caverns up and lineendhere down , and named them one and all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and all about was mine , lineendhere i said , the little sparrows overhead , lineendhere the little minnows , too . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this was the world and i was lineendhere king; for me the bees came by to sing , lineendhere for me the swallows flew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i played there were no deeper lineendhere seas , nor any wider plains than these , lineendhere nor other kings than me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at last i heard my mother lineendhere call out from the house at evenfall , to lineendhere call me home to tea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i must rise and leave lineendhere my dell , and leave my dimpled water well , lineendhere and leave my heather blooms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and as my home i neared , how lineendhere very big my nurse appeared , how lineendhere great and cool the rooms ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all round the house is the jet -- black night; it lineendhere stares through the window -- pane; it crawls in the corners , hiding from the lineendhere light , and it moves with the moving flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now my little heart goes a -- beating like a drum , with lineendhere the breath of bogie in my hair , and all round the candle the crooked lineendhere shadows come , and go marching along up the stair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shadow of the balusters , the shadow of the lineendhere lamp , the shadow of the child that goes to bed -- all the wicked shadows lineendhere coming , tramp , tramp , tramp , with the black night overhead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere late lies the wintry sun a -- bed , a frosty , lineendhere fiery sleepy -- head; blinks but an hour or two; lineendhere and then , a blood -- red orange , sets again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere before the stars have left the skies , at lineendhere morning in the dark i rise; and shivering in my lineendhere nakedness , by the cold candle , bathe and dress . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere close by the jolly fire i sit lineendhere to warm my frozen bones a bit; or with a reindeer -- sled , lineendhere explore the colder countries round the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when to go out , my nurse doth wrap me in lineendhere my comforter and cap; the cold wind burns my face and lineendhere blows its frosty pepper up my nose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere black are my steps on silver sod; thick blows lineendhere my frosty breath abroad; and tree and house , and hill lineendhere and lake , are frosted like a wedding -- cake . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i can in the lineendhere sorrel sit where the lineendhere ladybird alit . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i can climb the jointed grass; and on high lineendhere see the greater swallows pass in the sky , and the round sun lineendhere rolling by heeding no such things as i . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through that forest i can pass till , as in a lineendhere looking -- glass , humming fly and daisy tree and my tiny self i see , painted lineendhere very clear and neat on the rain -- pool at my feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere should a leaflet come to land drifting lineendhere near to where i stand , straight i'll board that tiny lineendhere boat round the rain -- pool sea to float . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere little thoughtful creatures sit on lineendhere the grassy coasts of it; little things with lovely lineendhere eyes see me sailing with surprise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere some are clad in armour lineendhere green -- (these have sure to battle lineendhere been ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) -- some are pied with ev'ry hue , black lineendhere and crimson , gold and blue; some have wings and swift are lineendhere gone; but they all look kindly on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere last , to the chamber where i lie my lineendhere fearful footsteps patter nigh , and come from out the cold and lineendhere gloom into my warm and cheerful room . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there , safe arrived , we turn about to keep lineendhere the coming shadows out , and close the happy door at lineendhere last on all the perils that we passed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , when mamma goes by to bed , she shall lineendhere come in with tip -- toe tread , and see me lying warm and lineendhere fast and in the land of nod at last . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the golden day is done , through lineendhere the closing portal , child and garden , flower lineendhere and sun , vanish all things mortal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as the blinding showers fall , lineendhere as the rays diminish , under evening's cloak they lineendhere all roll away and vanish . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere garden darkened , daisy shut , lineendhere child in bed , they slumber -- glow -- worm in the highway lineendhere rut , mice among the lumber . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the darkness houses shine , parents lineendhere move with candles till on all , the night divine lineendhere turns the bedroom handles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere till at last the day begins lineendhere in the east a -- breaking , in the hedges and lineendhere the whins sleeping birds a -- waking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the darkness shapes of things , houses , lineendhere trees and hedges , clearer grow; and sparrow's lineendhere wings beat on window ledges . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these shall wake the yawning maid , lineendhere she the door shall open -- finding dew on garden lineendhere glade and the morning broken . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there my garden grows again green and lineendhere rosy painted , as at eve behind the lineendhere pane from my eyes it fainted . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere just as it was shut away , lineendhere toy -- like , in the even , here i see it glow with lineendhere day under glowing heaven . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere every path and every lineendhere plot , every bush of roses , every lineendhere blue forget -- me -- not where the dew reposes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they cry , 'the day is come on the lineendhere smiling valleys; we have beat the morning lineendhere drum; playmate , join your allies ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ' birds all the sunny day flutter lineendhere and quarrel here in the arbor -- like lineendhere tent of the laurel . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here in the fork the brown lineendhere nest is seated; four little blue eggs lineendhere the mother keeps heated . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while we stand watching her , staring lineendhere like gabies , safe in each egg are the lineendhere bird's little babies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere soon the frail eggs they shall chip , lineendhere and upspringing make all the april lineendhere woods merry with singing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere younger than we are , o children , lineendhere and frailer , soon in blue air they'll be , lineendhere singer and sailor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we , so much older , taller lineendhere and stronger , we shall look down on lineendhere the birdies no longer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they shall go flying with lineendhere musical speeches high over head in lineendhere the tops of the beeches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in spite of our wisdom lineendhere and sensible talking , we on our feet lineendhere must go plodding and walking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all the names i know from nurse: lineendhere gardener's garters , shepherd's purse , bachelor's lineendhere buttons , lady's smock , and the lady hollyhock . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fairy places , fairy things , fairy lineendhere woods where the wild bee wings , tiny trees for tiny lineendhere dames -- these must all be fairy names ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tiny woods below whose boughs shady lineendhere fairies weave a house; tiny tree -- tops , rose or thyme , where lineendhere the braver fairies climb ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fair are grown -- up people's trees , but the lineendhere fairest woods are these; where if i were not so tall , lineendhere i should live for good and all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here is a child who clambers and scrambles , all lineendhere by himself and gathering brambles; here is a tramp who stands and gazes; lineendhere and there is the green for stringing the daisies ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here is a cart run away in the road lumping lineendhere along with man and load; and here is a mill and there is a lineendhere river , each a glimpse and gone forever ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this whistle lineendhere we made (and how clearly lineendhere it sounds ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) by the side of a lineendhere field at the end lineendhere of the grounds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of a branch of a plane , with a lineendhere knife of my own , it was nursie who lineendhere made it , and nursie alone ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what are you lineendhere able to build lineendhere with your blocks? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere castles and lineendhere palaces , temples lineendhere and docks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rain may keep raining and others lineendhere go roam , but i can be happy lineendhere and building at home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this one is sailing and lineendhere that one is moored: hark to the song lineendhere of the sailors on board ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and see the steps of my lineendhere palace , the kings coming and going lineendhere with presents and things ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now i have lineendhere done with it , down lineendhere let it go ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all in lineendhere a moment the town lineendhere is laid low . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere block upon block lying lineendhere scattered and free , what is there left of lineendhere my town by the sea? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gardener does not love to talk , he makes lineendhere me keep the gravel walk; and when he puts his tools away , lineendhere he locks the door and takes the key . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere away behind the currant row where lineendhere no one else but cook may go , far in the plots , i see lineendhere him dig , old and serious , brown and big . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he digs the flowers , lineendhere green , red and blue , nor wishes lineendhere to be spoken to . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he digs the flowers lineendhere and cuts the hay , and never lineendhere seems to want to play . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere summer goes , and winter comes lineendhere with pinching toes , when in the garden bare lineendhere and brown you must lay your barrow down . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere well now , and while the summer stays , to profit lineendhere by these garden days , o how much wiser you would be to lineendhere play at indian wars with me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here's peace for you , lineendhere and surety; here the one lineendhere wisdom -- the truth ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- "all day the good glad sun showers love lineendhere and labour on you , wine and song; the greenwood laughs , lineendhere the wind blows , all day long till night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and lineendhere night ends all lineendhere things . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then shall be no lamp relumed lineendhere in heaven , no voices crying , or changing lineendhere lights , or dreams and forms that hover ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (and , heart , for all your sighing , lineendhere that gladness and those tears are lineendhere over , over . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) and has the truth brought no lineendhere new hope at all , heart , that you're weeping lineendhere yet for paradise? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do they lineendhere still whisper , the lineendhere old weary cries? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "'mid youth and song , feasting and carnival , through laughter , through lineendhere the roses , as of old comes death , on shadowy and relentless feet , death , lineendhere unappeasable by prayer or gold; death is the end , the end ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " proud , then , clear -- eyed lineendhere and laughing , go to greet lineendhere death as a friend ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere exile of immortality , strongly lineendhere wise , strain through the dark with undesirous eyes lineendhere to what may lie beyond it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sets your lineendhere star , o heart , for lineendhere ever ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yet , behind the night , waits for lineendhere the great unborn , somewhere afar , some lineendhere white tremendous daybreak . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tenderly , day that i have loved , lineendhere i close your eyes , and smooth your quiet lineendhere brow , and fold your thin dead hands . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the grey veils lineendhere of the half -- light deepen; lineendhere colour dies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i bear you , a light burden , to the shrouded lineendhere sands , where lies your waiting boat , by wreaths of the sea's making mist -- garlanded , lineendhere with all grey weeds of the water crowned . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beyond the shifting cold twilight , lineendhere further than laughter goes , or tears , further than dreaming , lineendhere there'll be no port , no dawn -- lit islands ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the drear waste lineendhere darkening , and , at length , flame lineendhere ultimate on the deep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , the last fire lineendhere -- and you , unkissed , unfriended lineendhere there ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , the lone lineendhere way's red ending , and we lineendhere not there to weep ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (we found you pale and quiet , lineendhere and strangely crowned with flowers , lovely lineendhere and secret as a child . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you came with us , came lineendhere happily , hand in hand with the young lineendhere dancing hours , high on the downs at dawn ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) void now and tenebrous , lineendhere the grey sands curve before lineendhere me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from the inland meadows , fragrant of june and clover , floats lineendhere the dark , and fills the hollow sea's dead face with little creeping shadows , lineendhere and the white silence brims the hollow of the hills . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere close in the nest is folded every lineendhere weary wing , hushed all the joyful voices; and we , who held you dear , lineendhere eastward we turn and homeward , alone , remembering . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere day that i lineendhere loved , day that i lineendhere loved , the night is here ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i cower lineendhere to the earth , i waking , lineendhere i only . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high and cold lineendhere thou dreamest , o queen , high -- dreaming lineendhere and lonely . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and around lineendhere me the feet of thy lineendhere watchers tread . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is a rumour and a radiance lineendhere of wings above my head , an intolerable lineendhere radiance of wings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all the earth grows fire , lineendhere white lips of desire brushing cool lineendhere on the forehead , croon slumbrous things . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere earth fades; and the air lineendhere is thrilled with ways , dewy lineendhere paths full of comfort . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from quiet skies in lineendhere through the window my lineendhere lord the sun ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and my eyes were dazzled and drunk with lineendhere the misty gold , the golden glory that drowned and lineendhere crowned me eddied and swayed through the room . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere around me , to left and to right , hunched lineendhere figures and old , dull blear -- eyed scribbling fools , grew fair , lineendhere ringed round and haloed with holy light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere till the light faded; and they were lineendhere but fools again , fools unknowing , still scribbling , lineendhere blear -- eyed and stolid immortals . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky , lineendhere and smelt the sea , and earth , and the warm clover , and heard lineendhere the waves , and the seagull's mocking cry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and in them all was only lineendhere the old cry , that song they always lineendhere sing -- "the best is over ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you may remember lineendhere now , and think , and sigh , o lineendhere silly lover ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and i was tired and sick that all was over , lineendhere and because i , for all my thinking , never could recover lineendhere one moment of the good hours that were over . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i was sorry lineendhere and sick , and wished lineendhere to die . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then from the sad west turning wearily , i saw the lineendhere pines against the white north sky , very beautiful , and still , and bending lineendhere over their sharp black heads against a quiet sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and there was peace in them; and i was happy , and lineendhere forgot to play the lover , and laughed , and did no longer wish to lineendhere die; being glad of you , o pine -- trees and the sky ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere creeps in half wanton , lineendhere half asleep , one with a fat lineendhere wide hairless face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he likes love -- music that is cheap; lineendhere likes women in a crowded place; and lineendhere wants to hear the noise they're making . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his heavy eyelids lineendhere droop half -- over , great pouches swing lineendhere beneath his eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he listens , thinks himself the lineendhere lover , heaves from his stomach wheezy lineendhere sighs; he likes to feel his heart's a -- breaking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his little lineendhere lips are bright lineendhere with slime . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere music lineendhere swells . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere women lineendhere shiver . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and all the while , in lineendhere perfect time , his pendulous lineendhere stomach hangs a -- shaking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all the shade lineendhere is rife with magic lineendhere and movement . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i stray alone here lineendhere on the edge of silence , half afraid , lineendhere waiting a sign . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the deep heart of me lineendhere the sullen waters swell towards the moon , lineendhere and all my tides set seaward . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from inland leaps a gay fragment of some lineendhere mocking tune , that tinkles and laughs and fades along the sand , lineendhere and dies between the seawall and the sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere song of a tribe of the ancient lineendhere egyptians (the priests within the temple) she was wrinkled lineendhere and huge and hideous? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she lineendhere was our lineendhere mother . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she was lineendhere lustful and lineendhere lewd? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- but a lineendhere god; we had none lineendhere other . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the day she was hidden and dumb , lineendhere but at nightfall moaned in the shade; we shuddered and gave lineendhere her her will in the darkness; we were afraid . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (the people without) she sent us lineendhere pain , and we bowed before her; she smiled lineendhere again and bade us adore her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she solaced our woe lineendhere and soothed our sighing; and what lineendhere shall we do now god is dying? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (the priests within) she was lineendhere hungry and ate our children; lineendhere -- how should we stay her? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she took our young lineendhere men and our maidens; -- ours lineendhere to obey her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we were loathed and mocked lineendhere and reviled of all nations; lineendhere that was our pride . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she fed us , protected lineendhere us , loved us , and killed lineendhere us; now she has died . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (the people without) lineendhere she was so strong; but death lineendhere is stronger . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she ruled lineendhere us long; but time lineendhere is longer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (halted around the fire lineendhere by night , after moon -- set , they sing lineendhere this beneath the trees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) what light of unremembered skies lineendhere hast thou relumed within our eyes , lineendhere thou whom we seek , whom we shall find? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a certain odour on the wind , thy hidden lineendhere face beyond the west , these things have called us; on a quest older than lineendhere any road we trod , more endless than desire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere far god , sigh with thy cruel lineendhere voice , that fills the soul with longing for dim lineendhere hills and faint horizons ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for there come grey moments of the antient lineendhere dumb sickness of travel , when no song can cheer us; but lineendhere the way seems long; and one remembers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the beat of weary lineendhere unreturning feet , and songs lineendhere of pilgrims unreturning ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fires we lineendhere left are always burning on lineendhere the old shrines of home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our kin have built them temples , and therein lineendhere pray to the gods we know; and dwell in little houses lineendhere lovable , being happy (we remember how ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) and peaceful lineendhere even to lineendhere death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o thou , god of all long desirous lineendhere roaming , our hearts are sick of fruitless homing , lineendhere and crying after lost desire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as with fire lineendhere consuming dreams of lineendhere other bliss . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (sung , on one night , lineendhere in the cities , lineendhere in the darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ye are sober and dull lineendhere through the common day , but lineendhere now it is night ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is shameful lineendhere night , and god is lineendhere asleep ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (have you not felt the quick fires that lineendhere creep through the hungry flesh , and the lust of delight , lineendhere and hot secrets of dreams that day cannot say? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the house is lineendhere dumb; the night calls out lineendhere to you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down the dim stairs , through lineendhere the creaking door , naked , crawling on hands lineendhere and feet -- it is meet ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ye are men no lineendhere longer , but less and lineendhere more , beast and god . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down the lampless street , by little black ways , lineendhere and secret places , in the darkness and mire , faint laughter lineendhere around , and evil faces by the star -- glint seen -- ah ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for the darkness whispers lineendhere a blind desire , and the fingers lineendhere of night are amorous . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere because god put his adamantine fate between lineendhere my sullen heart and its desire , i swore that i would burst the iron lineendhere gate , rise up , and curse him on his throne of fire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an idle wind blew round lineendhere an empty throne and stirred the heavy lineendhere curtains on the walls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere before thy shrine i kneel , an unknown lineendhere worshipper , chanting strange hymns to thee and sorrowful litanies , incense lineendhere of dirges , prayers that are as holy myrrh . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , goddess , on thy throne of tears and faint low lineendhere sighs , weary at last to theeward come the feet that err , and empty lineendhere hearts grown tired of the world's vanities . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how fair this cool deep silence to lineendhere a wanderer deaf with the roar of lineendhere winds along the open skies ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sweet , after sting and bitter lineendhere kiss of sea -- water , the pale lethean wine lineendhere within thy chalices ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (from the train between lineendhere bologna and milan , lineendhere second class . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) opposite lineendhere me two germans lineendhere snore and sweat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through sullen lineendhere swirling gloom we jolt and lineendhere roar . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we have been here for lineendhere ever: even yet a dim watch tells two lineendhere hours , two aeons , more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the windows are lineendhere tight -- shut and slimy -- wet with lineendhere a night's foetor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there are two hours lineendhere more; two hours to dawn and lineendhere milan; two hours yet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere opposite lineendhere me two germans sweat lineendhere and snore . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one of lineendhere them wakes , and spits , and lineendhere sleeps again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere darkness lineendhere shivers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a wan light through lineendhere the rain strikes on our faces , lineendhere drawn and white . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere somewhere a new day sprawls; and , lineendhere inside , the foul air is chill , and damp , lineendhere and fouler than before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere out of the nothingness of sleep , the lineendhere slow dreams of eternity , there was a thunder on lineendhere the deep: i came , because you called to me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i broke the night's primeval bars , i lineendhere dared the old abysmal curse , and flashed through ranks of frightened lineendhere stars suddenly on the universe ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the eternal lineendhere silences were broken; hell lineendhere became heaven as i passed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- what shall i give you lineendhere as a token , a sign that lineendhere we have met , at last? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll break and forge the stars anew , shatter lineendhere the heavens with a song; immortal in my love for lineendhere you , because i love you , very strong . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then only in the empty spaces , death , lineendhere walking very silently , shall fear the glory of our lineendhere faces through all the dark infinity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so , clothed about with perfect love , the lineendhere eternal end shall find us one , alone above lineendhere the night , above the dust of the dead gods , alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we leave this resting -- place lineendhere made fair by one another lineendhere for a while . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , for a god -- speed , one last mad lineendhere embrace; the long road then , unlit lineendhere by your faint smile . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and you lineendhere so far lineendhere away ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , lineendhere i'll lineendhere remember ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere each crawling day will pale a lineendhere little your scarlet lips , each mile dull the lineendhere dear pain of your remembered face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere some day i shall rise and leave my friends and seek lineendhere you again through the world's far ends , you whom i found so lineendhere fair (touch of your hands and smell of your hair ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ), my only lineendhere god in the lineendhere days that were . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my eager feet shall find you again , though lineendhere the sullen years and the mark of pain have changed you wholly; for lineendhere i shall know (how could i forget having loved you so? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ), in the sad half -- light lineendhere of evening , the face that was lineendhere all my sunrising . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ), and i loved you before you were old lineendhere and wise , when the flame of youth was strong in your eyes , -- and lineendhere my heart is sick with memories . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere death will find me , long before i tire lineendhere of watching you; and swing me suddenly into the shade lineendhere and loneliness and mire of the last land ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there , waiting patiently , one day , i think , i'll feel a lineendhere cool wind blowing , see a slow light across the stygian tide , and hear lineendhere the dead about me stir , unknowing , and tremble . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- and turn , and toss your lineendhere brown delightful head amusedly , among lineendhere the ancient dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i said i lineendhere splendidly loved lineendhere you; it's not true . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such long swift lineendhere tides stir not lineendhere a land -- locked sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on gods or fools the high risk lineendhere falls -- on you -- the clean clear bitter -- sweet lineendhere that's not for me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love soars from lineendhere earth to ecstasies lineendhere unwist . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love is flung lineendhere lucifer -- like from lineendhere heaven to hell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere pleasure's lineendhere not theirs , nor lineendhere pain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they doubt , and lineendhere sigh , and do not love lineendhere at all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of lineendhere these am lineendhere i . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or lineendhere that foul lineendhere you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but this the strange gods , who had lineendhere given so much , to have seen and known lineendhere you , this they might not do . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one last shame's spared me , one lineendhere black word's unspoken; and i'm alone; and lineendhere you have not awoken . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- one moment , lineendhere what it is lineendhere to love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and yet -- the best that either's lineendhere known will change , and wither , and be less , at last , than lineendhere comfort , or its own remembrance . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and when some caress tendered in habit lineendhere (once a flame all heaven sang out to) wakes the shame unworded , in the lineendhere steady eyes we'll have , -- that day , what shall we do? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere being so noble , lineendhere kill the two who've reached their lineendhere second -- best? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere being wise , break lineendhere cleanly off , and lineendhere get away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere follow down lineendhere other windier skies lineendhere new lures , alone? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or shall we stay , since this is all lineendhere we've known , content in the lean twilight of such day , lineendhere and not remember , not lament? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so i , from paint , stone , tale , and rhyme , lineendhere stuffed love's infinity , and sucked all lovers of all lineendhere time to rarify ecstasy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere helen's the hair shuts out from me lineendhere verona's livid skies; gypsy the lips i press; lineendhere and see two antonys in your eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in a cool curving lineendhere world he lies and ripples lineendhere with dark ecstasies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there slipping lineendhere wave and shore are one , and lineendhere weed and mud . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere all's lineendhere one . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gentle , embracing , quiet , lineendhere dun , the world he rests in , world he knows , lineendhere perpetual curving . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere space is no more , lineendhere under the mud; his bliss is older lineendhere than the sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere silent lineendhere and straight the waters lineendhere run . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lights , the cries , the lineendhere willows dim , and the dark lineendhere tide are one with him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how lineendhere can lineendhere we find? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how lineendhere can we lineendhere rest? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how can we , lineendhere being gods , win joy , or peace , lineendhere being man? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love's lineendhere for lineendhere completeness ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no perfection grows 'twixt leg , and arm , elbow , lineendhere and ear , and nose , and joint , and socket; but unsatisfied sprawling lineendhere desires , shapeless , perverse , denied . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how can love triumph , how lineendhere can solace be , where fever turns lineendhere toward fever , knee toward knee? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i lineendhere went lineendhere on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for if my echoing footfall slept , soon a far lineendhere whispering there'd be of a little lonely wind that crept from tree to lineendhere tree , and distantly followed me , followed me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the blue vaporous end of lineendhere day brought peace , and pursuit baffled quite , lineendhere where between pine -- woods dipped the way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i turned , lineendhere slipped in and lineendhere out of sight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i trod lineendhere as quiet as lineendhere the night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the pine -- boles kept perpetual lineendhere hush; and in the boughs wind never lineendhere swirled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i found a flowering lowly lineendhere bush , and bowed , slid in , and sighed and curled , hidden lineendhere at rest from all the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i was lineendhere safe , and glad , lineendhere i knew ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yet -- with cold heart lineendhere and cold wet brows lineendhere i lay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere the lineendhere dark fell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there grew meward a sound of shaken lineendhere boughs; and ceased , above my intricate house; and lineendhere silence , silence , silence found me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i felt the lineendhere unfaltering movement lineendhere creep among the leaves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they shed around me lineendhere calm clouds of scent , that i did lineendhere weep; and stroked my face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere fell lineendhere asleep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere breathless , we flung us lineendhere on the windy hill , laughed in the lineendhere sun , and kissed the lovely grass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you said , "through glory and lineendhere ecstasy we pass; wind , sun , and earth remain , the lineendhere birds sing still , when we are old , are old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "and when we die all's over that is ours; lineendhere and life burns on through other lovers , other lips ," said i , lineendhere -- "heart of my heart , our heaven is now , is won ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "we are lineendhere earth's best , that learnt her lesson lineendhere here . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere life lineendhere is our lineendhere cry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we lineendhere have kept lineendhere the faith ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " we said; "we shall go lineendhere down with unreluctant tread lineendhere rose -- crowned into the darkness ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere proud we were , and lineendhere laughed , that had such brave lineendhere true things to say . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- and then you lineendhere suddenly cried , and lineendhere turned away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i dreamt i was in love again lineendhere with the one before the last , and smiled to greet the pleasant lineendhere pain of that innocent young past . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i jumped to feel how sharp had lineendhere been the pain when it did live , how the faded dreams lineendhere of nineteen -- ten were hell in nineteen -- five . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the boy's woe was as keen and clear , the lineendhere boy's love just as true , and the one before the last , lineendhere my dear , hurt quite as much as you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sickly i pondered how the lover lineendhere wrongs the unanswering tomb , and sentimentalizes lineendhere over what earned a better doom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gently he tombs the poor dim lineendhere last time , strews pinkish dust above , and lineendhere sighs , "the dear dead boyish pastime ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but this lineendhere -- ah , lineendhere god ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " -- better oblivion hide dead true loves , lineendhere better the night enfold , than men , to eke the praise lineendhere of new loves , should lie about the old ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bitter lineendhere thoughts i had lineendhere in plenty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but here's the worst of lineendhere it -- i shall forget , in nineteen -- twenty , you lineendhere ever hurt abit ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the stars , a jolly company , i lineendhere envied , straying late and lonely; and cried upon their lineendhere revelry: "o white companionship ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you only in love , in lineendhere faith unbroken dwell , friends radiant lineendhere and inseparable ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i , remembering , pitied lineendhere well and loved them , who , with lonely light , in empty lineendhere infinite spaces dwell , disconsolate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for , all the night , i heard lineendhere the thin gnat -- voices cry , star to faint lineendhere star , across the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he wakes , who never lineendhere thought to wake again , who held lineendhere the end was death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he opens eyes slowly , to lineendhere one long livid oozing plain closed down by lineendhere the strange eyeless heavens . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he lies; and waits; and once in lineendhere timeless sick surmise through the dead air heaves lineendhere up an unknown hand , like a dry branch . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i thought when lineendhere love for you died , lineendhere i should die . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alone , most lineendhere strangely , i lineendhere live on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere was called ambarvalia swings the way still by lineendhere hollow and hill , and all the world's a song; "she's far ," it sings me , "but lineendhere fair ," it rings me , "quiet ," it laughs , "and strong ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere spite of the miles and years between lineendhere us , spite of your chosen part , i do remember; lineendhere and i go with laughter in my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so above the little folk that know lineendhere not , out of the white hill -- town , high up i clamber; and lineendhere i remember; and watch the day go down . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they'll call the news from hill to hill , lineendhere dark and uncomforted , earth and sky and the winds; lineendhere and i shall know that you are dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall not hear your trentals , nor eat lineendhere your arval bread; for the kin of you will surely lineendhere do their duty by the dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their little dull greasy lineendhere eyes will water; they'll paw you , lineendhere and gulp afresh . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they'll sniffle and lineendhere weep , and their thoughts will creep like lineendhere flies on the cold flesh . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they will put pence on your grey eyes , lineendhere bind up your fallen chin , and lay you straight , the fools lineendhere that loved you because they were your kin . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they will praise all the bad about you , lineendhere and hush the good away , and wonder how they'll do without lineendhere you , and then they'll go away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with snuffle and sniff and handkerchief , lineendhere and dim and decorous mirth , with ham and sherry , they'll lineendhere meet to bury the lordliest lass of earth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the little dead hearts will tramp ungrieving lineendhere behind lone -- riding you , the heart so high , the heart so living , lineendhere heart that they never knew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall not hear your trentals , nor lineendhere eat your arval bread , nor with smug breath tell lies of lineendhere death to the unanswering dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with snuffle and sniff and lineendhere handkerchief , the folk who loved you not will bury lineendhere you , and go wondering back home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere you will lineendhere rot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but laughing and half -- way up to heaven , lineendhere with wind and hill and star , i yet shall keep , before lineendhere i sleep , your ambarvalia . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there was a damned lineendhere successful poet; there was lineendhere a woman like the sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere they lineendhere were dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they lineendhere did not know lineendhere it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they did not lineendhere know their time lineendhere was done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they did not know his hymns were lineendhere silence; and her limbs , that had served love so lineendhere well , dust , and a filthy smell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so knee to knee they sped lineendhere again , and laugh to laugh they ran , i'm lineendhere told , across the streets of hell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and then they suddenly felt the wind blow lineendhere cold , and knew , so closely pressed , chill air on lip and breast , and , lineendhere with a sick surprise , the emptiness of eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here , where love's stuff is lineendhere body , arm and side are stabbing -- sweet lineendhere 'gainst chair and lamp and wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in every touch more lineendhere intimate meanings hide; and flaming lineendhere brains are the white heart of all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here , million pulses to one centre beat: closed in by lineendhere men's vast friendliness , alone , two can be drunk with solitude , and lineendhere meet on the sheer point where sense with knowing's one . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though the woods are quiet , lineendhere and you've heard night creep along lineendhere the hedges . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere never go where tangled lineendhere foliage shrouds the crying bird , and the lineendhere remote winds sigh , and waters flow ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for moveless limbs no lineendhere pity i crave , that lineendhere never were swift ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still all i prize , laughter and thought and friends , lineendhere i have; no fool to heave luxurious sighs for lineendhere the woods and hills that i never knew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the more lineendhere excellent lineendhere way's yet mine ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and you flower -- laden come to lineendhere the clean white cell , and we talk as ever lineendhere -- am i not the same? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with our hearts we love , lineendhere immutable , you without lineendhere pity , i without shame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we talk as of old; as of old you go out lineendhere under the sky , and laughing , i know , flit through the streets , your heart all lineendhere me; till you gain the world beyond the town . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then -- i fade from your lineendhere heart , quietly; and your lineendhere fleet steps quicken . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the strong down smiles you welcome there; lineendhere the woods that love you close lovely and lineendhere conquering arms above you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o ever -- moving , lineendhere o lithe lineendhere and free ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fast in my linen prison i press lineendhere on impassable bars , or emptily lineendhere laugh in my great loneliness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and still in the white neat bed i strive most lineendhere impotently against that gyve; being less now than a thought , even , lineendhere to you alone with your hills and heaven . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hot through troy's ruin menelaus lineendhere broke to priam's palace , sword in hand , to sate on that adulterous lineendhere whore a ten years' hate and a king's honour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through red death , and smoke , and cries , and then lineendhere by quieter ways he strode , till the still lineendhere innermost chamber fronted him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he swung his sword , and crashed into lineendhere the dim luxurious bower , lineendhere flaming like a god . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high sat white lineendhere helen , lonely lineendhere and serene . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he had not remembered that she lineendhere was so fair , and that her neck curved down in such lineendhere a way; and he felt tired . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he flung the sword away , and lineendhere kissed her feet , and knelt before her there , the lineendhere perfect knight before the perfect queen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ii so lineendhere far the lineendhere poet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how should he behold lineendhere that journey home , the long lineendhere connubial years? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he does not tell you how white helen lineendhere bears child on legitimate child , becomes lineendhere a scold , haggard with virtue . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere menelaus bold lineendhere waxed garrulous , and sacked a hundred lineendhere troys 'twixt noon and supper . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and her golden lineendhere voice got shrill as he lineendhere grew deafer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere both lineendhere were old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere often he wonders lineendhere why on earth he went troyward , or why lineendhere poor paris ever came . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oft she weeps , gummy -- eyed lineendhere and impotent; her dry shanks twitch lineendhere at paris' mumbled name . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so menelaus nagged; lineendhere and helen cried; and paris slept on lineendhere by scamander side . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how should lineendhere i lineendhere know? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the enormous wheels lineendhere of will drove me cold -- eyed on tired lineendhere and sleepless feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere night was void arms and lineendhere you a phantom still , and day your far lineendhere light swaying down the street . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as never fool for lineendhere love , i starved for you; my throat was dry and lineendhere my eyes hot to see . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your mouth so lying was most lineendhere heaven in view , and your remembered lineendhere smell most agony . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i felt your hot wrist shiver lineendhere and suddenly the mad victory i planned flashed lineendhere real , in your burning bending head . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my conqueror's blood was cool as a deep lineendhere river in shadow; and my heart beneath your hand lineendhere quieter than a dead man on a bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere day after day you'll sit with him and note the lineendhere greasier tie , the dingy wrinkling coat; as prettiness turns to lineendhere pomp , and strength to fat , and love , love , love to habit ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o lithe and free and lightfoot , lineendhere that the poor heart cries to see , that's how lineendhere i'll see your man and you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- but you -- oh , when lineendhere that time comes , you'll lineendhere be dirty too ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my restless blood now lies a -- quiver , knowing that lineendhere always , exquisitely , this april twilight on the river lineendhere stirs anguish in the heart of me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and all these , like a waiting lover , lineendhere murmur and gleam , lift lustrous eyes , drift close to me , and lineendhere sideways bending whisper delicious words . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i stretch terrible lineendhere hands , uncomprehending , shaken with lineendhere love; and laugh; and cry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and hatred followed lineendhere after , shrilling madly lineendhere down the breeze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in peace from the wild heart of clamour , a lineendhere flower in moonlight , she was there , was rippling down white ways lineendhere of glamour quietly laid on wave and air . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her passing lineendhere left no lineendhere leaf a -- quiver . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere pale flowers lineendhere wreathed her white , lineendhere white brows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her feet were lineendhere silence on the lineendhere river; and "hush ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " she lineendhere said , between lineendhere the boughs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in darkness the loud sea lineendhere makes moan; and earth is shaken , and all evils lineendhere creep about her ways . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , now lineendhere to know you lineendhere sleep ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your magic and your beauty and lineendhere your strength , like hills at noon or sunlight on a lineendhere tree , sleeping prevail in earth and air . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the sweet gloom above the brown and white lineendhere night benedictions hover; and the winds of night move lineendhere gently round the room , and watch you there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and still lineendhere the darkness ebbs about lineendhere your bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere quiet , and lineendhere strange , and loving -- kind , lineendhere you sleep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and holy joy about lineendhere the earth is shed; and holiness lineendhere upon the deep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from the candles and dumb shadows , lineendhere and the house where love had died , i stole to the vast moonlight lineendhere and the whispering life outside . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i found no lips of comfort , no home lineendhere in the moon's light (i , little and lone and frightened in the unfriendly lineendhere night), and no meaning in the voices . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere far over the lands and lineendhere through the dark , beyond the ocean , i lineendhere willed to think of you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for i knew , had you been with me i'd lineendhere have known the words of night , found peace of heart , gone lineendhere gladly in comfort of that light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but ever desperately lineendhere i willed; till all grew soft and lineendhere far and silent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and suddenly i found you lineendhere white and radiant , sleeping quietly , lineendhere far out through the tides of darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love ," they said , lineendhere "is king of kings , and triumph lineendhere is his crown . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere earth fades in flame before lineendhere his wings , and sun and lineendhere moon bow down . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " -- but that , i knew , would lineendhere never do; and heaven lineendhere is all too high . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so whenever i lineendhere meet a queen , i said , i will lineendhere not catch her eye . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love ," they said , and "love ," they said , "the gift lineendhere of love is this; a crown of thorns about thy lineendhere head , and vinegar to thy kiss ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " -- but tragedy lineendhere is not for me; and i'm content lineendhere to be gay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so whenever i lineendhere spied a tragic lady , i lineendhere went another way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and so i never feared to see lineendhere you wander down the street , or come across the lineendhere fields to me on ordinary feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for what they'd never told me of , lineendhere and what i never knew; it was that all the lineendhere time , my love , love would be merely you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere safe in the magic lineendhere of my woods i lay , and watched lineendhere the dying light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere faint in the pale high solitudes , lineendhere and washed with rain and veiled by night , silver lineendhere and blue and green were showing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the spell was broken , the key denied lineendhere me and at length your flat clear voice beside me lineendhere mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you came and lineendhere quacked beside me lineendhere in the wood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you said , "the lineendhere view from here is lineendhere very good ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " you said , "it's lineendhere nice to be alone lineendhere a bit ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and , "how lineendhere the days are lineendhere drawing out ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you said , lineendhere "the sunset's pretty , isn't lineendhere it? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wish lineendhere -- i wish that you lineendhere were dead ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lip and eye flashed on the glory , shone and lineendhere cried , improvident , unmemoried; and fitfully and like lineendhere a flame the light of laughter went and came . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere proud in their careless lineendhere transience moved the changing lineendhere faces that i loved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere till suddenly , and lineendhere otherwhence , i looked upon lineendhere your innocence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for lifted clear and still and strange from lineendhere the dark woven flow of change under a vast and starless sky lineendhere i saw the immortal moment lie . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one instant i , lineendhere an instant , knew lineendhere as god knows all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and it lineendhere and you i , above lineendhere time , oh , blind ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere could see lineendhere in witless lineendhere immortality . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i saw the marble cup; the tea , hung on lineendhere the air , an amber stream; i saw the fire's unglittering lineendhere gleam , the painted flame , the frozen smoke . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere light was more lineendhere alive lineendhere than you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for suddenly , and lineendhere otherwhence , i looked on your lineendhere magnificence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dazed at length human lineendhere eyes grew , mortal strength wearied; and lineendhere time began to creep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere change closed lineendhere about me lineendhere like a sleep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere light glinted lineendhere on the eyes lineendhere i loved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cup lineendhere was lineendhere filled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere bodies lineendhere moved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the drifting lineendhere petal came lineendhere to ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the laughter lineendhere chimed its perfect lineendhere round . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the broken lineendhere syllable lineendhere was ended . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i , so certain and so lineendhere friended , how could i cloud , or how distress , the heaven lineendhere of your unconsciousness? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or shake at time's lineendhere sufficient spell , stammering lineendhere of lights unutterable? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the eternal holiness lineendhere of you , the timeless end , you never knew , lineendhere the peace that lay , the light that shone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you never knew that lineendhere i had gone a million miles lineendhere away , and stayed a million years . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the laughter played lineendhere unbroken round me; lineendhere and the jest flashed on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and we that knew the lineendhere best down wonderful hours lineendhere grew happier yet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i sang at heart , and talked , and lineendhere eat , and lived from laugh to laugh , i too , lineendhere when you were there , and you , and you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in a flowered dell lineendhere the lady venus stood , lineendhere amazed with sorrow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down the morning one far golden lineendhere horn in the gold of trees and sun rang lineendhere out; and held; and died . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she thought the lineendhere wood grew lineendhere quieter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wing , and leaf , lineendhere and pool of light lineendhere forgot to dance . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dumb lay the unfalling stream; lineendhere life one eternal instant rose in dream clear out lineendhere of time , poised on a golden height . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere till a swift lineendhere terror broke the lineendhere abrupt hour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gold waves purled lineendhere amidst the green above her; lineendhere and a bird sang . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with one sharp -- taken breath , by sunlit branches and lineendhere unshaken flower , the immortal limbs flashed to the human lover , lineendhere and the immortal eyes to look on death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the damned lineendhere ship lurched lineendhere and slithered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere quiet and quick my cold gorge rose; the long lineendhere sea rolled; i knew i must think hard of something , or be sick; lineendhere and could think hard of only one thing -- you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you , you alone lineendhere could hold my fancy lineendhere ever ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and with you lineendhere memories come , lineendhere sharp pain , and dole . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now there's a lineendhere choice -- heartache or lineendhere tortured liver ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a sea -- sick body , lineendhere or a you -- sick lineendhere soul ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do i lineendhere forget lineendhere you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere retchings twist and tie lineendhere me , old meat , good meals , brown lineendhere gobbets , up i throw . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere acrid return and lineendhere slimy , the sobs and slobber lineendhere of a last years woe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and still lineendhere the sick ship lineendhere rolls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis hard , i tell ye , lineendhere to choose 'twixt love and nausea , lineendhere heart and belly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all night the ways of heaven lineendhere were desolate , long roads across a lineendhere gleaming empty sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere outcast and doomed and driven , you and i , lineendhere alone , serene beyond all love or hate , terror or triumph , lineendhere were content to wait , we , silent and all -- knowing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly swept through the heaven lineendhere low -- crouching from on high , one horseman , downward lineendhere to the earth's low gate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , perfect from the ultimate lineendhere height of living , lightly we turned , through wet woods lineendhere blossom -- hung , into the open . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down the supernal roads , with plumes a -- tossing , purple lineendhere flags far flung , rank upon rank , unbridled , unforgiving , lineendhere thundered the black battalions of the gods . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through my heart's palace thoughts unnumbered lineendhere throng; and there , most quiet and , as a child , most wise , lineendhere high -- throned you sit , and gracious . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all day long great hopes gold -- armoured , jester lineendhere fantasies , and pilgrim dreams , and little beggar lineendhere sighs , bow to your benediction , go their way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the grave jewelled lineendhere courtier memories worship and lineendhere love and tend you , all the day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not now , when desire burns , and the lineendhere wind calls , and the suns of spring light -- foot dance in the woods , lineendhere whisper of life , woo me to wayfaring; ah ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not now should you come , now when the road lineendhere beckons , and good friends call , where are songs to lineendhere be sung , fights to be fought , yea ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the best of all , love , lineendhere on myriad lips fairer than lineendhere yours , kisses you could not give ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dearest , why should i lineendhere mourn , whimper , and whine , i lineendhere that have yet to live? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sorrow will i forget , tears for the best , love on lineendhere the lips of you , now , when dawn in the blood wakes , and the sun laughs lineendhere up the eastern blue; i'll forget and be glad ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still i abode strong lineendhere in a golden dream , lineendhere unrecaptured . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and , in the lineendhere heart of it , end of lineendhere labouring , you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere therefore i kept lineendhere ready the altar , lit lineendhere the flame , burning apart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere face of my dreams lineendhere vainly in vision white gleaming lineendhere down to me , lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for about midnight whispers lineendhere grew through the wood suddenly , strange cries in the lineendhere boughs above grated , cries like a laugh . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere silent and black then through the lineendhere sacred grove great birds flew , as a dream , lineendhere troubling the leaves , passing at length . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere therefore i go; never to lineendhere rest , or win peace , and worship of you more , and the lineendhere dumb wood and the shrine therein . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so light we were , so right we were , so lineendhere fair faith shone , and the way was laid so certainly , that , when lineendhere i'd gone , what dumb thing looked up at you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere was it something heard , or a sudden lineendhere cry , that meekly and without a word you broke the lineendhere faith , and strangely , weakly , slipped apart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you gave in lineendhere -- you , the proud of heart , unbowed lineendhere of heart ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere was this , friend , lineendhere the end of all that lineendhere we could do? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and have you found lineendhere the best for you , lineendhere the rest for you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere did you learn lineendhere so suddenly lineendhere (and i not by ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) some whispered story , that stole the glory from lineendhere the sky , and ended all the splendid dream , and made you go so lineendhere dully from the fight we know , the light we know? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the faith remains , and lineendhere i must pass gay down the lineendhere way , and on alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere under the grass you wait; the breeze lineendhere moves in the trees , and stirs , and calls , and covers you lineendhere with white petals , with light petals . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere good lineendhere sleep to lineendhere you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we have built lineendhere a house that is not for lineendhere time's throwing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we have gained a lineendhere peace unshaken by lineendhere pain for ever . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere war lineendhere knows no lineendhere power . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere safe shall be my going , secretly armed against lineendhere all death's endeavour; safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall; lineendhere and if these poor limbs die , safest of all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blow out , you lineendhere bugles , over the lineendhere rich dead ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there's none of these so lonely lineendhere and poor of old , but , dying , has made us lineendhere rarer gifts than gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blow , lineendhere bugles , lineendhere blow ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they brought us , for lineendhere our dearth , holiness , lacked lineendhere so long , and love , and pain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere honour has come back , as a king , to earth , and lineendhere paid his subjects with a royal wage; and nobleness walks in our lineendhere ways again; and we have come into our heritage . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these hearts were woven of lineendhere human joys and cares , washed marvellously lineendhere with sorrow , swift to mirth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the years lineendhere had given them lineendhere kindness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dawn was theirs , lineendhere and sunset , and the colours lineendhere of the earth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these had seen movement , and heard music; known slumber lineendhere and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; felt the quick stir of wonder; lineendhere sat alone; touched flowers and furs and cheeks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all lineendhere this is lineendhere ended . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there are waters blown lineendhere by changing winds to laughter and lineendhere lit by the rich skies , all day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and after , frost , with a lineendhere gesture , stays the waves that dance and lineendhere wandering loveliness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he leaves a white unbroken glory , lineendhere a gathered radiance , a width , a lineendhere shining peace , under the night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if i should die , think only lineendhere this of me: that there's some corner of a foreign lineendhere field that is for ever england . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mamua , when our laughter ends , and lineendhere hearts and bodies , brown as white , are dust about the doors of lineendhere friends , or scent ablowing down the night , then , oh ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , the wise agree , lineendhere comes our lineendhere immortality . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mamua , there lineendhere waits a land hard for us lineendhere to understand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere out of time , beyond the sun , all lineendhere are one in paradise , you and pupure are lineendhere one , and tau , and the ungainly wise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and my laughter , and lineendhere my pain , shall home to the lineendhere eternal brain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and there'll no more be one who dreams lineendhere under the ferns , of crumbling stuff , eyes of illusion , lineendhere mouth that seems , all time -- entangled human love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and you'll no longer swing and sway lineendhere divinely down the scented shade , where feet to ambulation lineendhere fade , and moons are lost in endless day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how shall we wind these lineendhere wreaths of ours , where there are lineendhere neither heads nor flowers? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- but we'll be missing the palms , and sunlight , lineendhere and the south; and there's an end , i think , of kissing , lineendhere when our mouths are one with mouth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tau here', lineendhere mamua , crown the lineendhere hair , and come away ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hear the calling of the lineendhere moon , and the whispering scents that stray about lineendhere the idle warm lagoon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hasten , hand in human hand , down the dark , the flowered lineendhere way , along the whiteness of the sand , and in the water's soft caress , wash the lineendhere mind of foolishness , mamua , until the day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere spend the glittering moonlight there lineendhere pursuing down the soundless deep limbs that gleam and lineendhere shadowy hair , or floating lazy , half -- asleep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dive and double and follow after , snare in flowers , lineendhere and kiss , and call , with lips that fade , and human laughter and faces lineendhere individual , well this side of paradise ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there's little lineendhere comfort in lineendhere the wise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love , in you , went passing by , penetrative , lineendhere remote , and rare , like a bird in the wide air , and , as the bird , lineendhere it left no trace in the heaven of your face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in your stupidity lineendhere i found the sweet hush after lineendhere a sweet sound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all about you was the light that dims the greying end lineendhere of night; desire was the unrisen sun , joy the day not yet begun , with lineendhere tree whispering to tree , without wind , quietly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wisdom slept within your hair , and long -- suffering lineendhere was there , and , in the flowing of your dress , lineendhere undiscerning tenderness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and when you thought , it seemed to me , lineendhere infinitely , and like a sea , about the slight world you lineendhere had known your vast unconsciousness was thrown . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o haven lineendhere without wave or lineendhere tide ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere silence , lineendhere in which all songs lineendhere have died ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere holy lineendhere book , where lineendhere hearts are still ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and home lineendhere at length under lineendhere the hill ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o mother quiet , lineendhere breasts of peace , where love itself lineendhere would faint and cease ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , ere the unthinking silence on that strife steals lineendhere down , i would cheat drowsy death so far , my night shall be remembered lineendhere for a star that outshone all the suns of all men's days . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shall i not crown them with immortal praise whom i lineendhere have loved , who have given me , dared with me high secrets , and in darkness lineendhere knelt to see the inenarrable godhead of delight? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love is a lineendhere flame; -- we have beaconed lineendhere the world's night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a city: lineendhere -- and we have built it , lineendhere these and i . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an emperor: lineendhere -- we have taught the lineendhere world to die . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dear names , and lineendhere thousand other lineendhere throng to me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and these shall pass , whatever passes not , lineendhere in the great hour , nor all my passion , all my prayers , lineendhere have power to hold them with me through the gate of death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they'll play deserter , turn with the traitor lineendhere breath , break the high bond we made , and sell love's trust and sacramented lineendhere covenant to the dust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the best i've known , stays here , and changes , lineendhere breaks , grows old , is blown about the winds of the world , and fades lineendhere from brains of living men , and dies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o dear my loves , o faithless , once again this lineendhere one last gift i give: that after men shall know , and later lovers , lineendhere far -- removed , praise you , "all these were lovely"; say , "he loved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " mataiea , 1914 fish (fly -- replete , in depth of june , dawdling lineendhere away their wat'ry noon) ponder deep wisdom , dark or clear , each secret lineendhere fishy hope or fear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fish say , they have their lineendhere stream and pond; but is there lineendhere anything beyond? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this life cannot be all , lineendhere they swear , for how unpleasant , lineendhere if it were ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one may not doubt that , somehow , good shall come lineendhere of water and of mud; and , sure , the reverent eye must lineendhere see a purpose in liquidity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we darkly know , lineendhere by faith we cry , the future is lineendhere not wholly dry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mud lineendhere unto lineendhere mud ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- death eddies near lineendhere -- not here the appointed lineendhere end , not here ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but somewhere , lineendhere beyond space lineendhere and time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is wetter lineendhere water , lineendhere slimier slime ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and there (they trust) there swimmeth one who swam ere rivers were begun , lineendhere immense , of fishy form and mind , squamous , omnipotent , and kind; and under that lineendhere almighty fin , the littlest fish may enter in . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and in that heaven lineendhere of all their wish , there shall be lineendhere no more land , say fish . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this i know , and lineendhere yet i know doubts that will lineendhere not be denied . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for if the soul lineendhere be not in place , what has laid lineendhere trouble in her face? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and if the spirit lineendhere be not there , why is fragrance lineendhere in the hair? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "oh love is fair , and love lineendhere is rare;" my dear one she said , "but love lineendhere goes lightly over . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " i bowed her foolish lineendhere head , and kissed her hair lineendhere and laughed at her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such a child was she; lineendhere so new to love , so true to love , and lineendhere she spoke so bitterly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have peace to weigh your lineendhere worth , now all is over , but if to praise lineendhere or blame you , cannot say . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for , who decries the loved , decries lineendhere the lover; yet what man lauds the lineendhere thing he's thrown away? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dear fool , pity lineendhere the fool who thought lineendhere you clever ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dear wisdom , do lineendhere not mock the fool lineendhere that missed you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere most fair , -- the blind lineendhere has lost your face lineendhere for ever ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere most foul , -- how lineendhere could i see you while lineendhere i kissed you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poor love of fools and blind lineendhere i've proved you , for , foul or lovely , lineendhere 'twas a fool that loved you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere somewhile before the dawn i rose , and stept softly lineendhere along the dim way to your room , and found you sleeping in the quiet lineendhere gloom , and holiness about you as you slept . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i knelt there; till your lineendhere waking fingers crept about lineendhere my head , and held it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i had rest unhoped lineendhere this side of heaven , beneath lineendhere your breast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i knelt a lineendhere long time , still; nor lineendhere even wept . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was great wrong you did me; lineendhere and for gain of that poor moment's kindliness , lineendhere and ease , and sleepy mother -- comfort ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere child , you know how easily lineendhere love leaps out to dreams like these , lineendhere who has seen them true . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and love that's wakened lineendhere so takes all too long to lineendhere lay asleep again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere waikiki , october 1913 lineendhere today i have been lineendhere happy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the pacific , october 1913 warm lineendhere perfumes like a breath from vine and tree drift down the lineendhere darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere plangent , hidden from eyes somewhere lineendhere an 'eukaleli' thrills and cries and stabs with pain lineendhere the night's brown savagery . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and dark scents whisper; and dim waves creep to me , gleam like lineendhere a woman's hair , stretch out , and rise; and new stars burn into the ancient lineendhere skies , over the murmurous soft hawaian sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down the blue night the unending columns press in lineendhere noiseless tumult , break and wave and flow , now tread the far south , or lift lineendhere rounds of snow up to the white moon's hidden loveliness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere some pause in their grave wandering comradeless , and lineendhere turn with profound gesture vague and slow , as who would pray good for the lineendhere world , but know their benediction empty as they bless . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they say that the dead lineendhere die not , but remain near to the rich lineendhere heirs of their grief and mirth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i think they ride the calm mid -- heaven , as these , in lineendhere wise majestic melancholy train , and watch the moon , and the still -- raging seas , lineendhere and men , coming and going on the earth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there the sure suns of these pale shadows move; there stand lineendhere the immortal ensigns of our war; our melting flesh fixed beauty lineendhere there , a star , and perishing hearts , imperishable love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dear , we know only that we sigh , kiss , lineendhere smile; each kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief goes over; lineendhere love has no habitation but the heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the dark flood we catch lineendhere awhile , cling , and are borne into lineendhere the night apart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the laugh dies lineendhere with the lips , 'love' with lineendhere the lover . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere south kensington -- makaweli , 1913 now that lineendhere we've done our best and worst , and parted , i would fill my mind with lineendhere thoughts that will not rend . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i would think of a thousand things , lovely lineendhere and durable , and taste them slowly , one after lineendhere one , like tasting a sweet food . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have need lineendhere to busy my heart lineendhere with quietude . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love is a breach in the walls , a broken lineendhere gate , where that comes in that shall not go again; love sells lineendhere the proud heart's citadel to fate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they have lineendhere known shame , who lineendhere love unloved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere some lineendhere share lineendhere that night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but they know love grows lineendhere colder , grows false and dull , that lineendhere was sweet lies at most . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere astonishment is no lineendhere more in hand or shoulder , but darkens , and lineendhere dies out from kiss to kiss . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all this is lineendhere love; and all love lineendhere is but this . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere heart , you are restless as a paper lineendhere scrap that's tossed down dusty pavements by the wind; saying , lineendhere "she is most wise , patient and kind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere come to lineendhere her , come lineendhere to her ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she will lineendhere not lineendhere care . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she'll smile to see me come , lineendhere so that i think all heaven lineendhere in flower to fold me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she'll give me all i ask , kiss me and hold me , lineendhere and open wide upon that holy air the gates of peace , lineendhere and take my tiredness home , kinder than god . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but , heart , lineendhere she will not lineendhere care . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your hands , my dear , adorable , your lineendhere lips of tenderness -- oh , i've loved you faithfully lineendhere and well , three years , or a bit less . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thank lineendhere god , lineendhere that's done ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i'll take the road , quit of my youth lineendhere and you , the roman road to wendover by tring and lineendhere lilley hoo , as a free man may do . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for youth goes over , the joys that fly , the tears lineendhere that follow fast; and the dirtiest things we do must lie lineendhere forgotten at the last; even love goes past . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what's left behind i shall not find , the splendour lineendhere and the pain; the splash of sun , the shouting wind , and the brave lineendhere sting of rain , i may not meet again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the years , that take the best away , give something lineendhere in the end; and a better friend than love have they , for none to lineendhere mar or mend , that have themselves to friend . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall desire and i shall find lineendhere the best of my desires; the autumn road , the mellow lineendhere wind that soothes the darkening shires . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere laughter , and lineendhere inn -- fires . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere white mist about the black hedgerows , the slumbering lineendhere midland plain , the silence where the clover grows , and the dead lineendhere leaves in the lane , certainly , these remain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i shall find some girl perhaps , lineendhere and a better one than you , with eyes as wise , but lineendhere kindlier , and lips as soft , but true . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i lineendhere daresay she lineendhere will do . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i came back late and tired last lineendhere night into my little room , to the long chair and the lineendhere firelight and comfortable gloom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i stood a moment lineendhere fierce and still , watching lineendhere her neck and hair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i made a step lineendhere to her; and saw that there lineendhere was no one there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was some trick of lineendhere the firelight that made lineendhere me see her there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was a chance lineendhere of shade and light and the lineendhere cushion in the chair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , all you happy lineendhere over the earth , that night , lineendhere how could i sleep? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lay and watched the lonely gloom; lineendhere and watched the moonlight creep from wall to basin , lineendhere round the room , all night i could not sleep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hands and lit faces lineendhere eddy to a line; the dazed last minutes lineendhere click; the clamour dies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beyond the great -- swung arc o' the roof , divine , lineendhere night , smoky -- scarv'd , with thousand coloured eyes glares the lineendhere imperious mystery of the way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thirsty for dark , you feel the long -- limbed lineendhere train throb , stretch , thrill motion , slide , pull out and sway , strain lineendhere for the far , pause , draw to strength again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- there is an lineendhere end appointed , o lineendhere my soul ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere crimson and green the lineendhere signals burn; the gloom is hung with steam's lineendhere far -- blowing livid streamers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lost into god , as lights lineendhere in light , we fly , grown one with lineendhere will , end -- drunken huddled dreamers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the white lineendhere lights lineendhere roar . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere sounds of the lineendhere world die . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lips and lineendhere laughter are lineendhere forgotten things . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere speed lineendhere sharpens; lineendhere grows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere into the night , and lineendhere on , the strength and splendour of lineendhere our purpose swings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere lamps fade; and lineendhere the stars . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we lineendhere are lineendhere alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all suddenly the wind comes soft , and lineendhere spring is here again; and the hawthorn quickens lineendhere with buds of green , and my heart with buds of pain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my heart all winter lay so numb , lineendhere the earth so dead and frore , that i never thought the lineendhere spring would come , or my heart wake any more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but winter's broken and earth has woken , and lineendhere the small birds cry again; and the hawthorn hedge puts forth lineendhere its buds , and my heart puts forth its pain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they queerly find some healing lineendhere so , and strange attainment in the touch; there is a secret lineendhere lovers know , -- i have read as much . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and theirs no longer joy nor smart , lineendhere changing or ending , night or day; but mouth to mouth , lineendhere and heart on heart , -- so lovers say . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere young mary , loitering once her lineendhere garden way , felt a warm splendour grow in the april lineendhere day , as wine that blushes water through . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and soon , out of the gold air of the afternoon , lineendhere one knelt before her: hair he had , or fire , bound back above his ears with lineendhere golden wire , baring the eager marble of his face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not man's nor woman's was the immortal lineendhere grace rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white , and lighting lineendhere the proud eyes with changeless light , incurious . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere calm as his wings , lineendhere and fair , that presence lineendhere filled the garden . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she stood there , lineendhere saying , "what would lineendhere you , sir? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he told lineendhere his word , "blessed art thou lineendhere of women ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her breath came quick lineendhere as little flakes lineendhere of snow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her hands crept lineendhere up her lineendhere breast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she did lineendhere but know it was lineendhere not hers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she felt a trembling stir lineendhere within her body , a will too strong for lineendhere her that held and filled and mastered all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with eyes closed , and a thousand lineendhere soft short broken sighs , she gave submission; lineendhere fearful , meek , and glad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she lineendhere wished to lineendhere speak . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her heart was faint for telling; to relate her limbs' sweet lineendhere treachery , her strange high estate , over and over , whispering , half revealing , lineendhere weeping; and so find kindness to her healing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'twixt tears and laughter , panic lineendhere hurrying her , she raised her eyes to lineendhere that fair messenger . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he knelt unmoved , immortal; with lineendhere his eyes gazing beyond her , calm to the calm skies; lineendhere radiant , untroubled in his wisdom , kind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his sheaf lineendhere of lilies stirred not lineendhere in the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere being tired , lineendhere she bowed her head; and said , lineendhere "so be it ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the great wings were lineendhere spread showering glory on the lineendhere fields , and fire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the whole air , singing , lineendhere bore him up , and higher , lineendhere unswerving , unreluctant . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere soon he shone lineendhere a gold speck in the gold lineendhere skies; then was gone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the air lineendhere was colder , lineendhere and grey . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere behind them , broken -- hearted , came grief , so lineendhere noisy a widow , that all said , "had he but wed her elder lineendhere sister sorrow , in her stead ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and by her , trying to soothe lineendhere her all the time , the fatherless children , colour , lineendhere tune , and rhyme (the sweet lad rhyme), ran all -- uncomprehending . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , at the way's lineendhere sad ending , round the raw lineendhere grave they stay'd . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere old wisdom read , in lineendhere mumbling tone , the service lineendhere for the dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beauty was there , pale lineendhere in her black; dry -- eyed; she lineendhere stood alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere poor maz'd imagination; fancy wild; ardour , lineendhere the sunlight on his greying hair; contentment , who had known youth lineendhere as a child and never seen him since . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and spring came too , dancing lineendhere over the tombs , and brought him flowers lineendhere -- she did not stay for long . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love had lineendhere died long lineendhere ago . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i know how the may fields all golden lineendhere show , and when the day is young and sweet , gild gloriously lineendhere the bare feet that run to bathe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'du lineendhere lieber lineendhere gott ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ' here am i , sweating , sick , and lineendhere hot , and there the shadowed waters fresh lean lineendhere up to embrace the naked flesh . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere temperamentvoll german lineendhere jews drink beer around; -- and there the dews are lineendhere soft beneath a morn of gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in lineendhere grantchester , lineendhere in grantchester ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- some , it may be , can lineendhere get in touch with nature lineendhere there , or earth , or such . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and clever modern men have seen a faun a -- peeping lineendhere through the green , and felt the classics were not dead , to glimpse a naiad's lineendhere reedy head , or hear the goat -- foot piping low: . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but these are lineendhere things i do lineendhere not know . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still in the dawnlit waters cool his ghostly lineendhere lordship swims his pool , and tries the strokes , essays the tricks , lineendhere long learnt on hellespont , or styx . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dan chaucer hears his river lineendhere still chatter beneath a lineendhere phantom mill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tennyson notes , with lineendhere studious eye , how cambridge lineendhere waters hurry by . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere till , at a shiver in the skies , vanishing with satanic lineendhere cries , the prim ecclesiastic rout leaves but a startled sleeper -- out , grey heavens , lineendhere the first bird's drowsy calls , the falling house that never falls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will pack , and take a lineendhere train , and get me to england lineendhere once again ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere strong men have run for miles and miles , lineendhere when one from cherry hinton smiles; strong men have blanched , lineendhere and shot their wives , rather than send them to st . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ives; strong men have cried like lineendhere babes , bydam , to hear what happened lineendhere at babraham . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in grantchester their skins are white; they lineendhere bathe by day , they bathe by night; the women there do all they lineendhere ought; the men observe the rules of thought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they love the good; they worship truth; they lineendhere laugh uproariously in youth; (and when they get to feeling lineendhere old , they up and shoot themselves , i'm told) . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to see the branches lineendhere stir across the moon lineendhere at grantchester ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to smell the thrilling -- sweet and rotten lineendhere unforgettable , unforgotten river -- smell , and hear the lineendhere breeze sobbing in the little trees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere say , do the elm -- clumps greatly lineendhere stand still guardians of that lineendhere holy land? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the chestnuts shade , in lineendhere reverend dream , the yet lineendhere unacademic stream? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is dawn a secret lineendhere shy and cold anadyomene , lineendhere silver -- gold? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and sunset still lineendhere a golden sea from haslingfield lineendhere to madingley? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and after , ere the lineendhere night is born , do hares come lineendhere out about the corn? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , is the water lineendhere sweet and cool , gentle and brown , lineendhere above the pool? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and laughs the immortal lineendhere river still under the mill , lineendhere under the mill? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere say , is lineendhere there beauty yet lineendhere to find? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere deep meadows yet , lineendhere for to forget the lies , lineendhere and truths , and pain? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yet stands lineendhere the church clock at lineendhere ten to three? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and is lineendhere there honey still lineendhere for tea? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere stars that seem so close and bright , watched lineendhere by lovers through the night , swim in emptiness , lineendhere men say , many a mile and year away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and yonder star that burns so white , lineendhere may have died to dust and night ten , maybe , or fifteen lineendhere year , before it shines upon my dear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere often among men below , heart cries lineendhere out to heart , i know , and one is dust a many lineendhere years , child , before the other hears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere heart from heart is all lineendhere as far , fafaia , lineendhere as start from star . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still no lineendhere one could see lineendhere me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but you lineendhere see lineendhere not . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere way of lineendhere love was thus . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he was born one winter lineendhere morn with hands delicious , and lineendhere it was well with us . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love came our quiet lineendhere way , lit pride in us , and died lineendhere in us , all in a winter's day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there lineendhere is no more lineendhere to say . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and innocence lineendhere accounted wise , and faith the lineendhere fool , the pitiable . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love so rare , one would swear all of lineendhere earth for ever well -- careless lips and flying hair , lineendhere and little things i may not tell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it does but lineendhere double the heart -- ache when i lineendhere wake , when i wake . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere thing lineendhere must end . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere am lineendhere no boy ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere being lineendhere twenty -- one . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere uncle , you make a great mistake , lineendhere a very great mistake , in chiding lineendhere me for letting slip a "damn ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " what's more , you called me "mother's lineendhere one ewe lamb ," bade me "refrain from swearing -- for lineendhere her sake -- till i'm grown up" . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i think you lineendhere take too much upon you , lineendhere uncle william ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you say i lineendhere am your brother's lineendhere only son . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere know lineendhere it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and , lineendhere "what lineendhere of it? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere something lineendhere must be lineendhere done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so shall i curb , so baffle , so lineendhere suppress this too avuncular officiousness , lineendhere intolerable consanguinity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ears satiate with the clamorous , timorous lineendhere whisperings of to -- day , thrilled to perceive once more the spacious lineendhere voice and serene utterance of old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fulfilled our hearts were with that music lineendhere then , and all the evenings sighed it to the dawn , and lineendhere all the lovers heard it from all the trees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all of lineendhere the accents upon lineendhere all the norms ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the stress on lineendhere the lineendhere penultimate ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we never lineendhere knew blank verse could have lineendhere such feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where lineendhere is it lineendhere now? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , more than ever , now i sometimes think no lineendhere poetry is read save where some sepultured caesura bled , lineendhere royally incarnadining all the line . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is the imperial iamb lineendhere laid to rest , and the young trochee , lineendhere having done enough? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the slow lineendhere lines lineendhere swell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere new lineendhere styles sighs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the celt moans lineendhere round with many lineendhere voices . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they'd snare the moon , and catch the immortal lineendhere sun with madder brown and pale vermilion , entrap an lineendhere english evening's magic hush . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still temporal , and still atmospheric , teleologically lineendhere unperturbed , we share a peace by no divine divined , an earthly garden hidden from lineendhere any cleric , untrodden of god , by no eternal curbed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hand trembling towards lineendhere hand; the amazing lights lineendhere of heart and eye . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they lineendhere stood on supreme lineendhere heights . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , the lineendhere delirious lineendhere weeks of honeymoon ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere soon they returned , and after strange lineendhere adventures , settled at balham by the lineendhere end of june , their money was in can . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere debentures , lineendhere and in lineendhere antofagastas . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still he went cityward lineendhere daily; still she did abide lineendhere at home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and both were really lineendhere quite content with work and social lineendhere pleasures . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they left three children lineendhere (beside george , who drank); the eldest jane , lineendhere who married mr . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bell , william , the head -- clerk in lineendhere the county bank , and henry , lineendhere a stock -- broker , doing well . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have risen to the uttermost heaven of joy , lineendhere i have sunk to the sheer hell of pain -- but -- it's not going to happen again , lineendhere my boy , it's not going to happen again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all in the town were still lineendhere asleep , when the sun came up with lineendhere a shout and a leap . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the lonely lineendhere streets unseen by man , a lineendhere little dog danced . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere the day lineendhere began . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all his life he'd been good , as far lineendhere as he could , and the poor little beast lineendhere had done all that he should . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but this morning he swore , lineendhere by odin and thor and the canine lineendhere valhalla -- he'd stand it no more ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so his prayer he got granted -- to lineendhere do just what he wanted , prevented lineendhere by none , for the space of one day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he fought with the he -- dogs , and lineendhere winked at the she -- dogs , a thing that had never lineendhere been heard of before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "for the stigma lineendhere of gluttony , i lineendhere care not a button ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he cried , and lineendhere ate all he could lineendhere swallow -- and more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he took sinewy lumps lineendhere from the shins of old frumps , and mangled lineendhere the errand -- boys -- when he could get 'em . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he shammed furious rabies , and lineendhere bit all the babies , and followed the cats lineendhere up the trees , and then ate' em ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the blood -- red sun had gone burning down , and the lineendhere lights were lit in the little town , outside , in the gloom of the twilight lineendhere grey , the little dog died when he'd had his day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "unstumbling , unreluctant , strong , unknowing , lineendhere borne by a will not his , that lifts , that grows , sweeps out to darkness , triumphing lineendhere in his goal , out of the fire , out of the little room . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i only know that , as he turned to go and lineendhere waved his hand , in his young eyes a sudden glory shone , and i was lineendhere dazzled by a sunset glow -- and he was gone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in alien earth , across lineendhere a troubled sea , his body lies lineendhere that was so fair and young . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his mouth is stopped , with lineendhere half his songs unsung; his arm is still , lineendhere that struck to make men free . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but let no cloud of lineendhere lamentation be where , on a lineendhere warrior's grave , a lyre is hung . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we keep the echoes of lineendhere his golden tongue , we keep the vision lineendhere of his chivalry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so israel's joy , the lineendhere loveliest of kings , smote now his harp , lineendhere and now the hostile horde . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to -- day the starry roof of heaven rings with psalms lineendhere a soldier made to praise his lord; and david rests beneath eternal lineendhere wings , song on his lips , and in his hand a sword . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , recollecting , lineendhere laughingly you turn , and look into lineendhere my eyes and take my hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere out of the primal dark he lineendhere leapt , like lyric lark , singing his aubade lineendhere strain; then fell to earth again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we garner all he gave , and lineendhere on his hero grave , for love and honour lineendhere strew , rosemary , myrtle , rue . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere son of the morning , we had kept lineendhere you thankfully; but yours the asphodel: lineendhere hail , singer , and farewell ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineage lineendhere so noble as from sires , laureled lineendhere by freedom? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for , who , but lineendhere the brave have glory lineendhere to transmit? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the hero's lineendhere grave blooms lineendhere ever . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere those crowns , not cold from death sweat on the lineendhere brow , at sight of apparitions with fixed stare , but warm with summer , lineendhere conjuring beauties rare -- wilt not . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are dewed daily lineendhere by your vow , daughters of sires who , lineendhere to no thrall , would bow ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere which , at the alter with raised hands , ye lineendhere swear , cheering the blessed spirits , gathered there , that , lineendhere like their mothers , are their daughters now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere true women -- and therefore , craft foilers clever -- lineendhere with sons for your hearts utterance , ye sue not , but like barry lineendhere to the british crew , ye cry out: "what ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these colors , since they drew lineendhere their first star -- breath , are god's , and lineendhere god's forever . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " ye know the lineendhere leopard changes not lineendhere his spots . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the prince of peace , who lineendhere spake eternal truth , confirmed lineendhere this fact of nature . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , yea , this beast makes his own desert , still; and ireland , lineendhere india and egypt show his spots so spread , he is one ghastly lineendhere glow; aye , as your sires saw him from bunker hill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , vain , gold lineendhere rubs the skin and lineendhere press shouts , "lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it has not lineendhere now one spot of threatening lineendhere ill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " o daughters of the brave , lineendhere well ye abjure the fiend lineendhere and all his works . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o mothers , as you lift your babes and gaze into lineendhere their eyes , your love runs through their vains in crimson flushes -- oh , your love lineendhere that pains at any of god's creatures hurt ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that stays; the heavens may pass lineendhere away , but that remains , being of lineendhere christ , who walks earth mother -- ways . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , like your sires , you , lineendhere too , know freedom's worth to lineendhere human spirit . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for its liberation , a lineendhere god unrealmed himself by tribulation , and lineendhere was an out -- cast on a scornful earth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere christ is no myth and , since with human birth he forms new lineendhere heavens for blissful habitation -- there unto is the freedom of the lineendhere nation; all other trend is down to dark and dearth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when from the darkness rainbowed birth lineendhere comes pouring , your virtue heeds the voice , lineendhere eternity -- re -- echos: "let them come . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 'tis nature's plea for broadening progress; lineendhere nay , 'tis god imploring the human to take strength for lineendhere liberty , truth , honor , to catch up to the stars , a -- soaring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o daughters lineendhere of brave sires , what is lineendhere true glory? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no marsh -- ward falling lineendhere star , however lineendhere bright . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis inspirational; its upward lineendhere flight lifts generations -- such your father's story , and also lineendhere yours , for is not that , too , gory? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you pour out your hearts blood in sons to lineendhere fight for honor , and cease not till every right lineendhere has been set down in triumph's inventory . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , into daughters , lineendhere too , old noble lineendhere mothers ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if christ's foreshadowing in juda's haze lineendhere was of his grief , 'tis of his triumph , here , for , is not his lineendhere celestrial glory clear in freedom for all men? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere first , gaseous rays in maryland , then rounded firm lineendhere full blaze in the republic , it draws every sphere of human welfare , whether lineendhere far or near , from depths occult to nights with dawns and days . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , ever mothers -- shaping lineendhere robust youth no less than infant , lineendhere and as perfectly ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there's life blood to their veins from when lineendhere on knee to when thy battle , from your broadening lineendhere ruth for human kind and fervent love of truth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if , like their fathers , they have come to lineendhere be the wonder of the world , for liberty , your virtue , lineendhere 'tis , that in their valor greweth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , as the roman mother , when she showed lineendhere for jewels , her two sons , saw each of them in time's tiara , lineendhere glittering there a gem; so , see your offspring shine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the light , bestowed your fathers , lineendhere in your sons is diamond flame , encircling lineendhere freedom's ocean -- walled abode . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere soar thou aloft , though lineendhere thou ascend alone , o lineendhere human spirit ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou lineendhere canst not lineendhere be lost . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what though yon stars , the azure's lineendhere nightly frost melt dark , or mount round lineendhere thee an arctic zone ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou hast sun -- warmth lineendhere and star -- source of lineendhere thine own . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if thou mount not , lineendhere how bitter is lineendhere the cost ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what anguish , when whirled down , or lineendhere tempest tossed , to know how high toward lineendhere god thou mightst have flown ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere vault lineendhere godward , lineendhere poet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what though few may lineendhere climb the mountain and the star lineendhere on trail of thee? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thy wing -- flash beams toward man , and , if it be lineendhere true inspiration -- whether thought sublime , or fervor for the truth , or lineendhere liberty -- thy light will reach the earth in goodly time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on them lineendhere he breathes with lineendhere dream and , lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an angel with a sword lineendhere agleam 'twix the old world and new lineendhere for justice's sake . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what sea so lineendhere broad , as that from lineendhere human weeping? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or sun so flaming , lineendhere as the angel's sword of human and devine lineendhere wills in accord? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there , with sword -- flash of myriad waves , lineendhere joy -- leaping , shall loom forever , freedom's watch and ward , with the lineendhere new world in his seraphic keeping . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this is thy lineendhere glory , man , that lineendhere thou art free . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis in thy freedom , lineendhere thy resemblance lies to lineendhere thy creator . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nature , which , tide -- wise , lineendhere is flood and ebb , bounds lineendhere not sky flight for thee . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as the sun arises from the sea , startling lineendhere all beauty god -- ward , thou dost rise with mind to god in heaven , from finite lineendhere ties , and there , in freedom , thou art great as he . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere meeting thy god with mind , 'tis thine to choose , wheather to lineendhere follow him with love and soar , or dream him myth and , rather than adore , lineendhere plunge headlong into nature's whirl and ooze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thine lineendhere is full lineendhere freedom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere could god do more lineendhere to liken thee to him , lineendhere and love , infuse? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god loves the stars; else lineendhere why star -- shape the dew for the lineendhere unbreathing , shy , heart -- hiding rose? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and when earth darkens , lineendhere and the north wind blows , why into

lineendhere john the baptist: "lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one lineendhere greater lineendhere nears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " what is this greater -- this which lineendhere is to meet the planets and ascend lineendhere high , high and higher? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the right of human spirit to aspire and mount , lineendhere unhampered -- and by act , complete creations harmony , as by lineendhere desire , proclaimed by brain with throb , by heart with beat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in thy descent through azures , all lineendhere aglow with circling spheres , the beauty of each lineendhere blaze , and grandeur , then , of all , entrance thy gaze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou thinkest , lineendhere why not thus all lineendhere life below? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere perceiving , then that all the breezes blow upward lineendhere and onward , in the skyey maze , thou wouldst go back and start with them , to lineendhere raise a new creation from chaotic throe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fain we follow thee in lineendhere flight from chaos to god's glory lineendhere round and round , aloft ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how like an elk pursued by hound , to brinks lineendhere thou springest toward the distant height and , on bent knees , then lineendhere speedest without sound , like faith through death , till , lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou lineendhere dost lineendhere alight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "ye wreaches , who would lay proud england's lineendhere head upon the block , and raise her features , then , bloodless lineendhere and ghastly , for the scorn of men ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere go where terrors lineendhere spread their sea and forest lineendhere mouths to crush you dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , how the clouds shall crimson from each glen , lineendhere a roar with blaze , and flame search out each fen , if back lineendhere to us , yea e'er are vomited . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " to this parental blessing and god -- speed , the pilgrim

thy lineendhere coast of hate and lie , lineendhere the nearer god . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- that is lineendhere our lineendhere creed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " o sun lineendhere and lineendhere stars ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bear ye lineendhere earth's thanks to god; lineendhere for oh ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what waters , slaking every thirst lineendhere of heart , mind , spirit , in long cascades burst from lineendhere plymouth rock , when struck by freedom's rod ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no wanderer in the lineendhere burning sand , unshod , plods man with lolling lineendhere tongue , dog -- like , as erst; for lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this fountain , deepening lineendhere from the first , floods earth's old wells lineendhere and greens life's sand to sod . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , more those waters than the lineendhere font of youth , for which , through field and lineendhere swamp , the spaniard ran ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for they are clear with god's lineendhere eternal truth of fatherhood , hence lineendhere brotherhood of man , and are no dream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they quench all human lineendhere drouth and cleanse man's desert dust of lineendhere sect and clan . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of expeditions in the arctic past , lineendhere all honor to the one that reached the pole and formed a settlement lineendhere where every soul enjoyed full freedom . lineendhere endlinehere

is ma -- jest -- y without lineendhere externals? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is burke's lineendhere analysis lineendhere not right -- "a jest"? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , but a jest , at which lineendhere the poor , oft pressed to their last heart -- drop , lineendhere laugh not , like court journals . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blares the tyrant's lineendhere horn and , in a thrice , lineendhere the tories gather . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere eagerly they band , lineendhere for is the king not greater lineendhere than the land? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and rows with lineendhere royalty , a lineendhere rabble's vice? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere besides , what creeping tribes lineendhere at his command ,

lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere watch them through the ages , lineendhere they pursue the noble and devour lineendhere all things divine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they illustrate

lineendhere mind and heart forever , vain the shrieks of freedom , lineendhere eagling back to dawn's first streaks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , yea , the sun stands , and the night afar lineendhere holds thrall , whose craft would swamp our noblest peaks and leave lineendhere but bubbling mud show where they are ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere glory flings his arms

well may hail; for , landing , they became lineendhere her staunchest host . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with what wild glee , the british set on fire yon lineendhere capital , beholding in its flames , america , robed in her deeds lineendhere and fames , in death throes at the stake of england's ire? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though that was long ago and , then no pyre , the lineendhere stake still stands; 'tis anglo -- saxon claims , and arnolds , bearing infamy's last names , lineendhere tilt schools to raise the stake flames high and higher . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , sight to strike the coming ages dead , my country , lineendhere were a cloud , thy mocking crown , and schools , ignited by truth's lamps hurled lineendhere down , to feed that

lineendhere free , an equity , not royal grant , sets bounds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no phaeton attempting phoebus rounds and burning lineendhere up earth's grass and forestry , is

lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "ye who enter , abandon lineendhere first all fratricidal hate ," proclaims the edict , lineendhere blazoned o'er each gate . lineendhere endlinehere

endlinehere startlinehere hark , lineendhere 'tis lineendhere the sea ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how lineendhere leonine lineendhere its roar ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but , oh , how more the lion on a height , lineendhere as there he glares and listens for the night , having lineendhere devoured day's clouds from shore to shore ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now grows his lineendhere mane of billows , high lineendhere and hoar . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere potencies escaping sight , lineendhere till , like the cold , they icily alight upon a lineendhere land where all was spring before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun darts lineendhere under earth and east again , lineendhere what sees he? lineendhere endlinehere

lineendhere white or lineendhere shadowy? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the scorn of human lineendhere rights , that can but lead the world lineendhere from doom to doom ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere for lineendhere what mead? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a bronze for rain and lineendhere rust , or effigy for nibbling lineendhere minutes -- ah , not hours ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- these flee to life's lineendhere progression -- truth and lineendhere kindly deed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere closely scanned , they are gross worms , each with the thought lineendhere to grow "the conqueror ," as staged by edgar poe for lineendhere darking planets and a world , last manned . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how weird lineendhere a lineendhere whisper ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis lineendhere from lineendhere wallabout . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis glory hoarse lineendhere with calling: "raise those hulks where lineendhere writhe my faithful . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere those mangled thousands lineendhere are not dead; they live , refashioned lineendhere men

startlinehere he creeps beneath the sun and , lineendhere ghastly gory , crys out: "thou yet lineendhere shall be the fugitive". lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , weirder grows the whisper into word , as sharp as lineendhere lightening , and as broad of reach , as seas , flung down by god to every lineendhere beach where thirsts a sparrow , or a bleating herd ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shouts of millions lineendhere shake oblivion's mire lineendhere and raise thrall's hulks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere justice's stooping sun , seeing in agony's each , a lineendhere washington , breaths life in them , and , over brooklyn's spire and new york's babel tower , they , lineendhere one by one , hold liberty's broading torch of quenchless fire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hate thou not any lineendhere man , for at the worst , he lineendhere still is brother . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere will a glance not find whole peoples lineendhere alchemied from heart and mind to steal projectiles by lineendhere a craft , accursed by human nature? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere aye , for , as they burst at dusk , or midnight , lineendhere slamming heaven behind and crashing hell wide open , 'tis lineendhere mankind is shattered and quick -- gulping grave slake thirst . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hate thou no man , but scorn all crafts , that lineendhere smelt the heart and mind for huge projectiles , shattered when lineendhere bursting grandly that some pride be flattered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nature beholds not saxon , slav , nor lineendhere celt; she only sees the human fragments scattered , and , lineendhere covering them , her eyes to rivers melt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere have i ever lineendhere been lineendhere untrue? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when , to thy moan of lineendhere hunger anywhere , lineendhere have i been deaf? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere was i not lineendhere quick to share my little , lineendhere nay , give all ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i knew thy beauty , and lineendhere my love such passion grew at thy lineendhere distresses , -- what would i not dare ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so , though the bellow , like lineendhere a grizzly bear , reared up before lineendhere me , on to thee i flew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is thy beauty lineendhere without heart , or lineendhere sense of justice? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere unto whom art thou lineendhere indebted for thine arm , encircling lineendhere now the world , sun -- like , more than to me? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my part i lineendhere glory in , for i have lineendhere kept my vow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hold lineendhere thee now to thine , if lineendhere true thou art . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when a haggard fugitive , thy lineendhere dwelling was a swamp , who first to trace thy crimson lineendhere footprints to thy hiding place? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with signs thou hadst not lineendhere many days to live , lineendhere i found thee . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere had the sun more lineendhere heart to give to warm lineendhere thee , than i gave? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , then and there thy lineendhere heart said to my heart; "ill would lineendhere i fare without thee . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i give lineendhere love for lineendhere love , believe". lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thy silence , lineendhere when in glory , lineendhere troubles me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere warm blood lineendhere dashed back cold , chills lineendhere to the bone ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineendhere do i lineendhere ask for? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only erin's own , that which god gave her , and , lineendhere if true it be , thou art the minister of justice grown , lineendhere thy gratitude should thunder god's decree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why bemoan one island in the sea , when i lineendhere can range like mountains , or , the sun , above all clouds , and , rosy from lineendhere my run to god , like morn , chant praise , since flesh of thee? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , yea , my pride and transport , verily , is , thou lineendhere and i eternally are one; and this god -- passion which no power can lineendhere stun , i owe to her , who gave her soul to me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis liberty , to whose most blessed birth the stars all lead , lineendhere rejoicing , which souls thee with god's compassion for humanity , -- that i invoke; lineendhere and , now , when all the earth bears palms and chants hosannas -- what ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shall she , the most devout , lineendhere be shut from freedom's lineendhere mirth? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all english lineendhere glory is in "kipling's lineendhere boots . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere read that poem true , lineendhere and answer , -- are those maddening lineendhere men not you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "boots , boots , boots , and no lineendhere discharge from war ," -- that is the lineendhere empire's anthem . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere brass it out , lineendhere ye lineendhere orchestras ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but oh , leave not in doubt its import , kipling , -- that lineendhere 'tis maelstrom roar -- 'tis england's streams of home -- life , world about and lineendhere down a gulf , for greed and pride on shore ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere aye , weapons only; for , to whom belong lineendhere the minds of england , and treed fields of song -- nay , lineendhere all but grave -- ground , grudged by hill and plain? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o english people , whom the crafty class has lineendhere huddled into graves from sight and sound of what god hands you , lineendhere and , with pence , or pound , lids down your wild dead stare , -- wake ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see in the celts spring -- burst lineendhere from underground , the human lineendhere resurrection come to pass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , what are england's lines lineendhere of lords and kings , shakespeare , to thine , a -- throb lineendhere with thought and feeling? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere righteousness lineendhere of england ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "tis to kneel full weight on weaker nations , lineendhere and entone hosannas louder than the victims groan; lineendhere then , stooping , drink their blood with gulps of zeal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " what right have wounds , lineendhere though wide , to throb , lineendhere or feel? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis blasphemy lineendhere to england's crimson lineendhere throne . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere knee -- deep in erin's lineendhere blood , she mocks christ's moan: forgive lineendhere them , lord ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they lineendhere know not their true lineendhere weal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "whose lineendhere is the lineendhere fault? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tis not my arrogance , lineendhere but candor , lord , that puts the lineendhere blame on thee . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what right hadst thou to make lineendhere these people free and let all nature lineendhere prompt them to advance? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- oh , no such blunder , lord , lineendhere hadst thou called me , instead of wisdom , lineendhere to approve thy plans ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the bard's curse: "ruin lineendhere seize thee ruthless king ," took bat -- like lineendhere form for hollow echo -- flight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , to my sight , lineendhere how grows its grimness , while lineendhere eternaling ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere deep are the minds of wales , but far more deep lineendhere the horror , gulfed out by mccreedy , firing on lineendhere men defenseless and , through want , expiring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , from that gulf the bard's curse makes a sweep lineendhere up to the sun and , from its long desiring , grown eagle , lineendhere shrieks to heaven from steep to step ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "a dirty work ," said dyer , lineendhere rebuked for spilling hundreds of lives to lineendhere irrigate new lands . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a dirty work , but not lineendhere for british hands , dabbling in lineendhere blood to earn each day their shilling . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mohawk valley and wyoming , chilling with lineendhere thought of tarleton's king -- serving bands , and canada red -- clayed , though high snow stands , lineendhere cry: work for which the british are too willing ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere invaded lands need terror lineendhere irrigation to make lineendhere them fruitful . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the ocean , holding pure the azure's lineendhere blue , laughs at the tempests , with one empire's dust lineendhere after an other , to round out earth's crust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere look in the sea and deep , lineendhere what scattered rock , the islands which lineendhere at dusk , the tempest piled ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ere rose lineendhere a star , they sank with lineendhere crews , beguiled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o tempests that with world formations , lineendhere mock the good creator , how , as ye grow wild , earth quakes lineendhere and no live thing survives the shock . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our country is lineendhere not rock and wood and stream , but lineendhere soul transfusing them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineendhere is the lineendhere soul? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the soul , then , -- our true country , -- is the brave lineendhere who fought and bled for freedom , or will fight to their lineendhere last pulse , last breath , for human right . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , how like bubbles in the wave , lineendhere are the sierras in cerulean flight , to thy lineendhere true grandeur , letting nought enslave ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o thou art character -- art lineendhere only those who formed the good and lineendhere great by thought , or deed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no mere foot -- shadow , on time's wall , art thou , lineendhere without eye -- sparkle , swing of arm , warm flow from heart lineendhere to vain , and cheeks with health of glow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , 'tis eternal heights reflect thy lineendhere brow and shoulders , that avert man's overthrow , threatened lineendhere all times , and never more than now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , what if lineendhere lone and long thy lofty lineendhere flight , my country? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is thy vision not as lineendhere clear as that of vesper , dauntless pioneer lineendhere on twilight's altitude? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how thy lone loftness , aloof lineendhere from wrong , refracting man -- ward , god's enrapturing smile lineendhere of fruitful fields , leads legions ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on they file and phalanx , and lineendhere the vision makes thee strong: what , though god's searchlight lineendhere flares the sky the while? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it nears not lineendhere thee , ear -- close to heaven's lineendhere high song . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from out a desert where the lineendhere trails run red , judah and erin speed lineendhere their camel pace , sighting green palms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " who , in descent from heaven's ecstatic throng , was lineendhere twin to light , and ranged from source to sea , and shore to peak , and god , drew lineendhere up to thee the generations happy , pure and strong? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere freedom , as erin's was , ere lineendhere ruthless wrong caught , scourged and hanged it on the lineendhere out -- law's tree; and is; for lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it proves divinity , lineendhere transfiguring from anguish , lineendhere ages long . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere true , they have strangled freedom on lineendhere the cross of every right's suppression -- nay , have barred lineendhere his body's tomb , and placed a host on guard ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still , he is lineendhere risen; his faithful lineendhere mourn no loss . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he shines lineendhere forth in their lineendhere midst . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no bolts retard lineendhere his entrance , where grand aims lineendhere for life engross . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fight in lineendhere ireland is lineendhere 'twixt man and brute . lineendhere endlinehere

the serpent's substitute ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , all ye lineendhere peoples of the world lineendhere draw nigh ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how help love thee , whose hand , lineendhere raised to the sun , glows rosy , and lineendhere not red with murder's stain? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere angels lineendhere kiss it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere force can lineendhere forge no chain to lineendhere drag thee false -- ward . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like a holy nun , stigmated , lineendhere how thy faith grows with thy pain -- aye , till thy lineendhere cross , like constantine's has won . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in rapt , roused erin , who does not lineendhere behold a venus , rising from the sea of lineendhere tears , up to her native , earth -- illuming spheres? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where the green lineendhere and orange morn unfurls , see lineendhere erin rise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how shine her lineendhere golden lineendhere tresses ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they form her crown , for trailing rocks down whirls , and reaching lineendhere all the under -- sea recesses , they draw about her brow , the rarest pearls -- lineendhere love for what frees and hate for what oppresses ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere look , lineendhere human lineendhere nature ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where else canst thou lineendhere boast to the eternal lineendhere stars , so grand a sight? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how men there ennoble lineendhere human kind by making liberty lineendhere the light to peace ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who but sees in the unconquerable lineendhere celtic mind that , even in time , there are eternities -- lineendhere love , true to right , and will no wrong can bind ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why play lineendhere with lineendhere words? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there never lineendhere can be peace till ireland lineendhere is set free . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her spirit is no lineendhere norbury banshee -- to wail lineendhere and , then , to vanish . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she will stand with lifted flambeau , lighted by lineendhere the hand that lights the stars , till she again is free , inspiring normal lineendhere man in every land with love of freedom , by her scorn of thee . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere stop foul god -- slaughter where to not rebel , lineendhere in order to develop and excel , were god lineendhere in man , succumbed to age -- longed blights . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " where heavenward rose lineendhere the god in man of old , staunch lineendhere stand these wardens . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sleepless , they behold lineendhere each turn of england's lineendhere evil eye . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they call , when she would form the fulminate lineendhere of gold , a thumb and finger -- pinch of which , let fall , might blast lineendhere columbia's peaks to slit of thrall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of all the fulminates , gold is the worst , which lineendhere england , aeroplaning , now , lets drop by day and night , in bank , press , church and lineendhere shop , timed to the minute that it is to burst . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere list to demosthenes , lineendhere if not to hearst , sublime lineendhere republic ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lest thy great heart stop , shocked by lineendhere the blast of freedom's every prop , and lineendhere bats and owls in dwellings , human's erst . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she drops her gold , lineendhere in creeping beneath lineendhere free athens' sky -- ascending stair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere watch lineendhere her with glance of lineendhere sword . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , watch , for where lineendhere she sows her gold , she comes lineendhere with scythes for reaping ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is athens in ascent lineendhere with sun -- light flare , to come down ashes , lineendhere not worth history's keeping? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- sole trail , as lineendhere time , who peers through grief , lineendhere discerns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o caledonia , by thy burn's brave lineendhere song , and deeds of wallace and paul jones for right , thy mother knows lineendhere thee in the dark of night , and claps thee heart -- close . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she cries lineendhere out: "be strong , soul lineendhere of my soul ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though not a boswell lineendhere quite , still , be whole lineendhere man ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere remember lineendhere glencoe's lineendhere wrong . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there's england's lineendhere soul of merciless lineendhere intriguing ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis the lineendhere bagpipes welcoming lineendhere the guest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see the lineendhere assembly , lineendhere dance and feast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , watch the open heart lineendhere and flow of good old scotch; the english come , lineendhere as friends , must have the best . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there , hospitality lineendhere is at top notch , -- and so is lineendhere treachery in britain's breast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere cock lineendhere crows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- is lineendhere he lineendhere dreaming? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis lineendhere dark lineendhere still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he crows again and now , from farm lineendhere to farm , his fellows echo far his dazed alarm lineendhere and flap of wings on fences . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with such lamp in hand lineendhere as glencoe's horror , lineendhere thou hast england true . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why let froude fiction lineendhere haze thy vivid lineendhere view? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere put not thy light out for sound sleep , lineendhere but stand and answer , when the mother , whom thou lineendhere drew thy soul from , cries "glencoe"! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when lineendhere black lineendhere and taned . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o canada , lineendhere long red with cottage lineendhere flame from britain's torch ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thy blasts milk not the cloud to nourish lineendhere hope; instead , they spread the shroud on human spirit lineendhere answering freedom's claim . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whence comes the cold which icicles with shame , thy heart's lineendhere niagara , that should thunder loud unto thy far off soul in sorrow , lineendhere bowed o'er papineau , whom thraldom could not tame? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whence comes this lineendhere cold to freedom's lineendhere claim? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we know only too well , -- from creatures of the lineendhere king , who had dragged hell of every poisonous thing lineendhere and , through our country , had spread waste and woe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beaten at last , they flocked like carion crow , on lineendhere the dead body of their will to sting , which drifting northward , and lineendhere enlargening , loomed dante's nimrod , 'mid the arctic snow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with sun -- warmth for truth and lineendhere human right , is lineendhere boreus met . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who hurles lineendhere him down lineendhere the deep? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere look close; -- 'tis gladden who , on freedom's steep , is as lineendhere inspiring , as , on andes' height , the great christ statue , bidding rancor lineendhere sleep and life's diverging rays in love , beam light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why lineendhere all this sleigh -- bell lineendhere rhyming? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god said to wrong: lineendhere "no further shalt lineendhere thou go . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " this , monroe lineendhere heard and held , then , in lineendhere his heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was this he repeated , lineendhere when on chart he made his markings , checking lineendhere freedom's foe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god never grants to wrong the right to grow; because lineendhere he sets its bounds , does not impart his blessing on its growth , more than its lineendhere start; his blessing goes to right , to overthrow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , let thine lineendhere eyes for migratory lineendhere flight speed southward ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere passing prejudice's lake , green -- crusted with stagnation lineendhere which some take for verdure , they will see from andes' height , how freedom's battle forms the lineendhere red day -- break , and tides are swells from thrall , hurled deep from sight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from south lineendhere to north , no sky lineendhere is black but thine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we seek no lineendhere annexation , but of lineendhere mind , heart , spirit . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rise , and be one lineendhere on the new world's star -- top lineendhere of liberty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "the angels come in lineendhere dreams ," says holy writ; and science says , lineendhere "no sleep so deep , but dreams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whose pure soul and heart embrace translates lineendhere me into heaven , i draw for breath the joy of lineendhere angels who have not known death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere child -- like , i look up in thy loving lineendhere face , else gaze around and point , and curious place lineendhere my hand on mottoes , hung on high . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one saith: "beware , lineendhere for he not with lineendhere me scatterith . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " its meaning lineendhere comes to me with lineendhere growth , like grace . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere think the tyrant , whose great soul is trade , whose history , lineendhere a crater , belching black and lurid , keeps glad easter morning back from lineendhere half the world -- loves thee save to invade , as blackward planned? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere loves thee , along whose track lineendhere march human rights up to lineendhere the stars parade? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there where the tyrant long lineendhere has loomed , wreck -- crowned , are young and old lineendhere hurled to the coast and blast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere frail are their ships; still , lineendhere sun , why glare aghast , watching the lineendhere billows monstering around? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the soul lineendhere of man was not born to lineendhere be drowned . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it mounts and mounts , till , at god's throne , at last , lineendhere and freedom welcomes it with arms , sky -- vast , as down lineendhere it comes to meet thrall and confound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o , deathless spirit , born of hosts lineendhere sea -- hurled , who hast out soared night's stars with lineendhere agony's cry for justice ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou hast come down from the sky , heralding doom lineendhere to thrall , whose flag unfurled by steel , or craft , shows , as 'tis hoisted high , lineendhere the blood of man and ruin of the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineendhere is lineendhere the truth? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the thought , the act , or cry , lineendhere recasting the supreme intelligence; lineendhere all else is false . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where are stars so dense , lineendhere that each has not the freedom lineendhere of the sky? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and , still , lineendhere what peace , what glory , lineendhere reigns on high ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with the lineendhere wisdom of the lineendhere heavens , dispense? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the peace , for which our lineendhere longings grow intense , comes through the stars lineendhere to earth , and but thereby . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what splits lineendhere dark mid -- night and gives earth lineendhere a thrill? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all stars lineendhere merged into one -- our country's lineendhere aim . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is a lightening , formed by god , to flame across lineendhere the ages and flash bolts to kill the stranglers , who the heart or spirit , lineendhere main , or choke black in the face , a people's will . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who is to rise and hurl god's lineendhere flame world -- wide , as lincoln hurled it , setting free a race from lineendhere sphinx -- shaped wrong -- a beast with human face? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that shattered , how our lineendhere land rose glorified and , from the lineendhere stars last laggard , soared , their guide ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , who can take promethean lineendhere lincoln's place , to bring light where -- so -- ever he can trace a lineendhere human , with his rights to soul denied? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he must be one , not only to illume all ages , lineendhere and not leave one region dim , but at no height , allow his senses swim , lineendhere or let mirages lure him with false bloom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here one comes with all lineendhere the virtues prim to hurl god's lineendhere fire and end all human gloom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis wilson lineendhere takes god's flame from lincoln's lineendhere hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why not hurl them lineendhere and convince the world that , lineendhere hence -- forth , not one thrall shall stand? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wilson's arm lacks strength to lineendhere hurl the flame , god gave to lincoln lineendhere for the human race? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere quenched by lineendhere dark lineendhere space? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no; it describes an orbit there , the same lineendhere as comets , and regains its heavenly place for lineendhere one to hurl it true , and doom earth's shame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in wilson we beheld lineendhere and proudly hailed the world's lineendhere deliverer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in him , we saw a lineendhere luminous being rise from earth lineendhere and draw all lands above the clouds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we were regaled with justice lineendhere cascades flow , long ice impaled lineendhere upon high mountains . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere was not nature's lineendhere thaw from his heart heat for lineendhere truth , eternal law? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his was lineendhere the heat of all lineendhere the stars , he scaled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though his ascension was like christ's , sublime lineendhere with lift of continents and every isle , he , lineendhere less than christ , succumbed to demon guile . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , god , that he should drop his mountain lineendhere climb below sea -- level , and let earth the while , fall back lineendhere and settle in primeval slime ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , such his truth to god , -- so oft avowed , -- lineendhere a spirit thund'red from a luminous cloud: lineendhere "this man crowns lincoln's work . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " oh , had lineendhere he read his bible lineendhere where st . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul , grown man , put off lineendhere child things -- or , had not smiled , when told , strong ego lineendhere oft , is man grown child ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who sees not an epoch's angel lineendhere fall from hope for earth , in wilson's truth , beguiled by lineendhere second childhood's toys to play with thrall? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our country lineendhere still is in the lineendhere womb , dark time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it shows life by its brisk and lineendhere robust turns , which thrill the mother , liberty , lineendhere who yearns to see her man -- child born . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , how sublime with genius , not of one , but every lineendhere climb where art forms beauty , or the spirit spurns the foul and spurious , -- her lineendhere desire , that burns prenatally in him , to form him prime ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh people , all -- italian , spanish , french , lineendhere dutch , english , irish , german , jew , and greek -- what see lineendhere you , as you climb the future's peak? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what looms there , shall wrench from life , all lineendhere monsters out from hell , to seek dead consciences lineendhere and plague earth with their stench . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ascend , o lineendhere land of every lineendhere creed and race ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not thy full image , in new england's lineendhere brook , nor in the south's lagoon; though there , a look delights lineendhere us with thy chubby , infant face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis seas of joy , that shorelessly replace the ocean lineendhere which , in time of old , forsook the prairies for the cloud , or spring lineendhere in nook , -- that show thee , grown , through god's abundant grace . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere behold two fleets , the lineendhere one with woe for trail , the lineendhere other , rapture . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as they sight the strait , through which but lineendhere one can pass , greed , urged by hate , drives thraldom's lineendhere crafts with help of steam and gale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they lineendhere feel their lineendhere way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the guns , with which they hale , raise jets , that look tall lineendhere elms from hope , the gate , to peace , the palace; then , their speed is great , lineendhere manoeuvering fast to head off , or assail . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere drawing the sea up for his driving steam , greed breaks all lineendhere mirrors in his grand state room , that show him dark inevitable lineendhere doom , close hovering , and exults: "i am supreme . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when seas lack water for my lineendhere funnel fume , i bid life send its lineendhere every crimson stream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the darkness lowers lineendhere boat after boat from freedom's fleet , lineendhere and each with lightening oars? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere treasons to god lineendhere and country are lineendhere the rowers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are the gold and lineendhere hireling brain , that gloat on conscience lineendhere body with face down , afloat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why hail they greed , to run on lineendhere menial chores from deck to deck , lineendhere or to and from all shores? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to ensure lineendhere the payment of lineendhere a note . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere meanwhile , brisk freedom's fleets with justice manned , lineendhere and cosmic full momentum for their speed , confront lineendhere the crafts , fired up by fiendish greed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a lineendhere clash lineendhere and -- lo ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they pass the strait and land , leaving in lineendhere smoldering heaps , like autumn's weed , the hulks of lineendhere thrall along time's vultured strand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere are lust for gold and power lineendhere not hideous spawn of prehistoric lineendhere reptiles , that had wings? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where e'er those crawled , they chawed all greening things and , lineendhere when they mounted , how their lengths , full drawn , basked barren in the sun before lineendhere the dawn , absorbing all its rays from budding springs? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these drain life's dawn and by lineendhere impoverishings , draw and reduce lineendhere to pulp , frail consciences . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , yea , bewinged with legislative crime , they bask lineendhere in sunlight e'er the east sky greys , and drag the soul of lineendhere man from god's embrace of rights and freedom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , how long a time shall reptiles , lineendhere deadly to the human race , be let grow lineendhere wings and heavenward trail their slime? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what though fine graphic sketches lineendhere in magazines show them with shoulders bold against lineendhere the nights flood -- gates of dark and cold? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all effort lineendhere is but life in death -- throw lineendhere stretches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o heart and brain , who see the father lineendhere load his train with food , not for the few , but all , and hear lineendhere train -- whistlings in march winds , jay call and ground -- hog sniffs ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o heart and brain , it lineendhere rest with you , how long the legislative lineendhere wreckers shall prevail . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ye have lineendhere the power to lineendhere balk them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere regain lineendhere your lineendhere legislatures . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere man them strong and drive thence all lineendhere sleek hounds , trust -- trained to trail safe outlaws' paths lineendhere to fastnesses of wrong . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere was ever such unblushing lineendhere harlotry , such sale of virtue in the lineendhere market place , as by the press? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the red paint on her lineendhere face is degradation's lineendhere mark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alas , that she , born to bring forth the truth , lineendhere still , is so base , she kills her child and , then , to hide all trace , lineendhere cracks bone by bone to dust , too fine to see . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o press , poor harlot of lineendhere the tyrant , gold , what freedom , but lineendhere from truth , hast thou to boast? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hark , who now speaks is lineendhere murdered truth's pale ghost: "conceiving lineendhere life -- oh , bring it forth ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere aye , hold thy lineendhere child on high with lineendhere love , as priest , the host ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere crush not lineendhere its bones , with smile and eyes lineendhere set cold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the focus of lineendhere all rays passing through nature lineendhere and the soul and mind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is the sun of lineendhere suns , around which wind the heavens lineendhere and all the worlds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such is its blaze , that had it not , at intervals , lineendhere a haze , grading both angel and the human -- kind , the bright arch -- angel would be stricken lineendhere blind , to grope in heaven , a homer , sighing lays . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what less could fitly crown lineendhere omnipotence than truth , the focus lineendhere of all rays in good? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there it shines upon the holy rood , breaking through lineendhere clouds , a -- massing dark and dense from countless ages , cains to brotherhood -- lineendhere with rays of pardon for the world's offense . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they lineendhere know not what lineendhere they do . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all grandeurs , gathered as a dazzling lineendhere crown for thee , in barter for thy knee's least bend , the lineendhere demon dashed to fragments to time's end . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there , born anew in spirit , we look lineendhere down and , in the ocean of thy prayer , amen'd , lineendhere see but earth's monsters , with the demons drown . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thought is truth's echo -- not her lineendhere glorious eyes beholding god , nor her white lineendhere arms of light , lifted in worship . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere following truth , our lineendhere flight at highest range is where lineendhere our echo dies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh all your lineendhere power and beauty , lineendhere earth and skys ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and , lineendhere soul and lineendhere mind ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your beauty and your might -- truth lineendhere gathers in one flash and , catching sight of god , lineendhere lifts high in love's full sacrifice . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere twixt truth and thought , what truth is lineendhere oft is space wherein , with intuition lineendhere for her wing , the soul mounts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is there i hear her sing: "lo , truth , so swift lineendhere aloft , thought dies in chase , turns earthward , and the gifts her white arms lineendhere bring , are outshone by god's glory in her face ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " ah , lineendhere what is lineendhere heaven? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such glory that sun -- light lineendhere seems darkness , and mass lineendhere music , shell -- shut sound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what we call senses here , there so abound , lineendhere the soul appears a broadening heaven in flight , feathered and lineendhere downed with all the stars , whose white is all hues mingled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , the lineendhere awe lineendhere profound ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for every moment lineendhere there , new heavens astound the myriad lineendhere senses , with god's love and might . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if "holy , lineendhere holy , holy , lineendhere evermore? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere was not humility the earthward lineendhere stair from highest heaven , by which god came to men , to lineendhere show the way aloft to human ken? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , by what other pass , are men to fare lineendhere through mist and cloud , except the path , aflare with his lineendhere blest steps from heaven , and up again? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere steps , not from star to lineendhere star , but fen to fen , that all might follow lineendhere and not one despair ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , lineendhere steps lineendhere of love ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere could we reach with our eyes their lineendhere fulgence , we would shrink back with dismay; for , though lineendhere 'tis through the world's contempt move they -- hark ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how the hidden choirs of countless lineendhere skies chant at all heights: "lo , god comes by this way , and lineendhere makes world -- wide , his stair to paradise ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh cataracts , beyond the lineendhere angels' count , pause and shine pendant over every lineendhere deep of heart , mind , spirit ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how down they sweep to basic good where , massing , lineendhere they remount , till , mid god's "many mansions ," high they leap , forming lineendhere forever , joy's most splendent fount ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when , at god's fiat , light flashed lineendhere forth , the beam evolved a million pigments , lineendhere as it sped to every nature . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for , harboring lineendhere meaner thought were lineendhere to blaspheme . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what , if the world be chaos where lineendhere it sins , race feuds , creed hatreds , falsehoods gross , deceit , intrigue lineendhere and greed , form swirling , blinding sleet? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere honor and truth , though buried to their lineendhere chins , look up and smile; for , though the storms still beat , the poets lineendhere show 'tis spring , not winter , wins . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not mine the night that creeps beneath lineendhere life's sea , or lurks within hope's ruins , sunk below lineendhere the desert , or the stagnant pool -- oh , no ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , once the cold of all the unsunn'd lineendhere space was in my reptile life of soul , wing -- bound; but now , lineendhere soul -- free , what warmth from stars all round ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis not by strength of mine , lord , but lineendhere thy grace , my soul soars from the depths of sea , or ground , lineendhere till , at star -- heights , it meets thee , face to face ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what but the lineendhere spirit's ladder to god's lineendhere throne is beauty? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , there , lineendhere what joy , my lineendhere prize ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere would that i had lineendhere a dove for every lineendhere boon ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun is lineendhere god's great joy to lineendhere human sight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , up lineendhere and off in lineendhere chariots , sea ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and ride , all generations , lineendhere up , till mountain -- eyed , to welcome earth -- ward , god's lineendhere supreme delight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere imagination swirls in swallow lineendhere flight , giddy with beauty , deepening -- oh , how glide from star lineendhere to star , to the haloes , season -- dyed and countless ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere its wings shrivel lineendhere up like lineendhere night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , yea , the sun in lineendhere one subliming rise from wisdom's lineendhere infinite mind ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this lineendhere reason lineendhere knows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it lineendhere has lineendhere no set . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there , sense , with weals or woes lineendhere for beads , or fingers , count our lineendhere shuts of eyes , excluding knowledge . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god's joy to lineendhere close and all its goodness lineendhere break and drift cloud -- wise? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there are two darknesses; lineendhere one where the lord hides beauty -- that by lineendhere which men know his face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all , in that darkness , feel his fingers trace their lineendhere features gently , and their hearts record the feeling , as of one , whose eyes , lineendhere restored , would see , but for the father's close embrace . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the other is the outer lineendhere dark -- a place where hate turns black the lineendhere light upon it poured . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a spirit passed the sun , lineendhere the moon and star , and dwelled and dreamed lineendhere in darkness all its own . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , if where love was not , he lineendhere smiled elate , his smile at god returned , a lineendhere lightening flash that shattered him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he saw his planets clash , burst and , then , by lineendhere the downward law of hate , sink and leave not a single spark , nor lineendhere ash , for the new firmament he would create . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there are lineendhere two gods -- one , good , lineendhere the other , ill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they clash in nature -- so lineendhere the persian taught , and long a sect lineendhere in europe spread the thought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god said , "let lineendhere there be light ," and light lineendhere was made . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god made not darkness -- that is light's exclusion , forming a region lineendhere where , in wild confusion , men , nations , each a ferret , blood -- eyed shade , worry each other , till , lineendhere with disillusion for lamp , comes conscience , crying , "god betrayed ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " ah , in the lineendhere angel -- fall from heaven , lineendhere is hope? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wing -- whir discord of the lineendhere legion's fall from god forever , lineendhere mocks my heart's loud call . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere empty of beauty lineendhere from its base to cope , the lineendhere earth is hollow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where , then , can i lineendhere grope and not be met by lineendhere echoes that appal? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shouts my mind , in wonder lineendhere that i crawl and , having skyey wings , lineendhere in hollows mope . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere does scent from bloom , or warble lineendhere from the wood , not atmosphere the un -- aerial void twixt lineendhere thee and beauty , which thy youth enjoyed? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fly back to earth , by memory renewed; lineendhere she fills the hollow , echoing hosts destroyed , -- with spring , lineendhere reflecting heaven's triumphant good . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the dimple of lineendhere thy cheek , my love could live lineendhere forever and be blest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there , with the sun , a rose -- bud on lineendhere thy breast , how thou rejoicest , hastening lineendhere to speak to thy fond father ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , how vain to seek a sweeter refuge lineendhere for the spirit's rest , than mid thy blushes , when thou lineendhere marvelest at his great love , for , oh ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thy lineendhere heart is lineendhere meek . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in thy lineendhere father's lineendhere arms , thou art . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beauty is love and , lineendhere hence is heightening fire , lineendhere consuming nature . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all the dark can lineendhere bring to quench it , lineendhere feeds it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how everything lineendhere is caught in the blaze , which mounts lineendhere up high and higher ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere truly , 'tis a vision to inspire the soul with transport , lineendhere more than joy can sing; for , if not for the blaze , what cold would sting poor lineendhere mortals , who crowd round it , nigh and nigher ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is beauty not the lineendhere camp -- fire , which one host leaves burning for lineendhere another , close behind? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yea , yea , the lineendhere powers divine , o lineendhere human kind ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere have left their camp -- fire burning on the lineendhere coast , where they embarked from glimpse of human mind , to give lineendhere you warmth and light to hold your post . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all beings , legioning lineendhere celestial light , moved in procession lineendhere toward a vacant throne . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their chant was lineendhere faith and hope , as , lineendhere now , our own . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at last , lineendhere it came to pass , their faith lineendhere grew sight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they saw one star in night's down -- fall , stay white and , by the lineendhere holy spirit brighter blown , ascend in heaven , till there , as high lineendhere and lone , as over nature's marveling zenith height . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere reaching lineendhere the throne , its queen , lineendhere this star became . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god lets drop blue doves which ground the lineendhere mind like clover; then , with drawing to the skies , lineendhere his pleasure is to watch the flocks arise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , to his love , lineendhere how great our lineendhere spirit's worth ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere each lineendhere is as lineendhere all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in heaven , lineendhere no heart still lineendhere heaves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this lineendhere temple is lineendhere soul -- startling . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis to me a thunder lineendhere storm in stone , with sinai flare lineendhere across the ages . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis the fiend's lineendhere despair and the arch -- angel's lineendhere triumph . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it sets free the mind and soul lineendhere with certitude , christ's key which , like the sun , lineendhere opes heaven -- the good and fair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still , oft , what darkness lineendhere drowns the sun's noon glare within lineendhere the temple ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis lineendhere from lineendhere calvary . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , 'tis lineendhere from lineendhere calvary's grief . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with heart pain and with lineendhere quiver of the lip , i bid my boy lineendhere "good bye ," with words of cheer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hug him to my heart to hide a tear , lineendhere and hold him close so long , that no tongue -- slip could more betray my lineendhere bodings for his ship , or troop , when landed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is when i hear my daughters' lineendhere voices , that i shame off fear and take my lineendhere boy's both hands with firmest grip . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dost thou , mad kaiser , lineendhere for historic name , set lineendhere fire to europe? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o lineendhere twin of lineendhere chaos ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere peer lineendhere thou through the lineendhere haze ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis human lineendhere beings feed the crackling lineendhere flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beware , the smoke , like etna's , is the curse of lineendhere widows on thy people -- dooming throne , and in no country , more than in lineendhere thine own , cry out all mothers: "wherefore bear and nurse? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to feed war with our lineendhere sons , our flesh and bone , that chaos lineendhere may reclaim the universe? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the german mother has lineendhere too long been what a chancellor lineendhere once called the "kingdom's cow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " ah , as she bears the droves for lineendhere slaughter , how her dumb -- beast eyes crave lineendhere pity for her lot ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see , there she smiles , like lineendhere loving god forgot -- all his lineendhere supernal patience on her brow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how long must her grand lineendhere arch of brain , as now , bear up a lineendhere universe "of what should not"? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there , lies she , crushed by troops in hot pursuit lineendhere of mocking shadows; for be gain complete , what is lineendhere it but twin brother to defeat? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere stand up the lineendhere dead on any bloody lineendhere route . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere stoop for no lineendhere kiss from orphans , at lineendhere thy feet , o triumph ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for ash -- cord lineendhere is all lineendhere thy fruit . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o lineendhere fair , full lineendhere moon ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere look close at thy lineendhere face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou must be happy , being lineendhere in the skys; and , yet , thy flush grows lineendhere pallor to mine eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou art as one , who lineendhere breathless after chase , would rest , but dreads to lineendhere check her onward pace . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o fugitive from where no fledgling lineendhere flies , no bee finds bud , and where red billows rise , engulfing lineendhere down dark years , the human race ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o thou pale moon , who lineendhere hast companioned man through every lineendhere darkness since the night's first fall ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how glares the tiger lineendhere in his desert lair -- lineendhere now half the world ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beholding with dismay that human freedom is lineendhere the tiger's prey , a giant , down whose shoulders , broad and bare , the long , thick , crimson lineendhere flow is sampson's hair , makes haste to clutch the beast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , how the clay beneath their lineendhere struggle , reddens , night and day , till lies the lineendhere beast , a shapeless carcass there ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where flies our flag is lineendhere freedom's holy ground; there , it unfurls lineendhere all benisons to man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the twin of spring , its spread unfolds lineendhere god's plan of human happiness , by setting bound to lineendhere greed , lust , powers , -- all colds , -- that right be crowned . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where it leads , ye youth form valor's van , lineendhere mirrored and echoed by the azure's span for lineendhere ages , for man's gain in yours is wound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , justice's hot gulf lineendhere stream are ye , who open the sea , which lineendhere fiendish craft has frozen hard ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , may your warmth for righteousness transform the tyrant's lineendhere artic region , with no hope in , to freedom's temperate zone , which they , lineendhere who guard the planets , save from wreck by quake or storm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now and in life -- not virgil -- breaks lineendhere a storm of harpies , harsh to lineendhere ear and foul to smell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it sweeps war's lineendhere lengthening coast , where each lineendhere sea -- swell is humans , gasping . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis the laughter of the lineendhere stars at earth , and nature's , too , with lineendhere every pitch of voice . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere earth's carnival of sheer grotesque and noise , lineendhere where , gagged and manacled , walk peace and mirth , shows britain now , a lineendhere beast of broadening girth , set out to crush world freedom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he destroys , and thinks his lineendhere bear -- like rearing , planet poise that is to lineendhere influence the world's new birth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that is why lineendhere the stars laugh , and all nature lineendhere jeers the show . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lord , not thy work , lineendhere the world's calamities , lineendhere but man's . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there the brine is anguish , and lineendhere there triumph leaves no sign , save wreck on lineendhere rock , and plague , adrift on breeze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when nations turn from light , in thought , or lineendhere life , their speed is brink -- ward , save thy mercy stay; for all lineendhere is precipice , except thy way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere help , lord , for here is heightening surge of lineendhere strife; here , clouds turn floods , coasts are wind -- whirled , like spray , and lineendhere lightenings , hurling back thy light , are rife . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere religion lineendhere is lineendhere ascension . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis the flights lineendhere of souls to summits of the lineendhere true and wise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one , witnessing the generations rise , sees them lineendhere a shine at countless , different heights , where they , responding to their lineendhere inner lights , glow , like the clouds at morn , with graded dyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if summits , there are depths; lineendhere if virtue , vice; hence , 'tis life's rise lineendhere from falls , that judgment sights . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how thy half lineendhere century shines lineendhere over head ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis an unfading rain -- bow , one whose lineendhere dyes are richer and more numerous to the lineendhere eyes of angels , than to ours . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere its rays , if spread above a lineendhere flood of sin and world of dead , give to lineendhere the drowned , new life , new earth , new skies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere night counts her stars , but falters , lineendhere when souls rise bright with the grace which god's lineendhere annointed shed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere belov'd irene , how lineendhere great our joy to see thine arch , aglow lineendhere with virtue's every hue ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , how much more must they rejoice , lineendhere who view from inner heaven , the arch lineendhere that is for thee , triumphal ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for than vows like thine , lineendhere lived true , no grander arch from lineendhere earth to heaven could be . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the "church lineendhere triumphant" shines in lives lineendhere like thine , calista ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis the saints' procession , shown in dante's lineendhere vision , near lord jesus' throne , in greatening lineendhere splendor , never to decline . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , if our minds grow dark , our hearts repine , lineendhere how , from sweet lives , dear sister , like thine own , be -- mothering with mercy all who lineendhere moan , a light comes , and a warmth is in its shine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we shade our eyes , as when we face lineendhere the sun on level with the earth , at lives all love -- lineendhere the church triumphant , as in heaven above ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere aye , lives all love for christ , in every lineendhere one who suffers wrong , or any pain thereof , as lineendhere on his throne -- such lives as thine , dear nun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once , blindness was a burning lineendhere ship at sea , with panic -- stricken souls lineendhere on every deck . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the flame blew inward on lineendhere that awful wreck , burning the hopes that lineendhere make life glad and free . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , through thee , it was , philanthropy , who trains lineendhere her searchlight on the smallest speck and speed out boats , like horses , neck lineendhere to neck , reached the dark hulk and thrilled its crew with glee . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the flame lineendhere is quenched , that burned out lineendhere heart and brain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the ship where lineendhere woe was mute , is lineendhere loud with joy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hear the cheer lineendhere on board , and cry , lineendhere "ahoy ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " as fast the sails are hoisted , and the lineendhere main tides back toward hope for every girl and boy , lineendhere who , else , might reach no star of night's whole train . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above and under lineendhere life , eternally , a subtle light lineendhere and dark run parallel . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one prompts men to build beauty , cell lineendhere by cell , in home , religion , state , society; the lineendhere other , to destroy the fair they see . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like spring , wilt thou lineendhere roof earth with bloom and lineendhere dwell thereunder? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or , with scalping lineendhere winter's yell , scour lineendhere grove and bush? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere choose -- how lineendhere else art thou lineendhere free? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if freedom is the gift of lineendhere the all -- wise , it is because he will not lineendhere have a slave to serve him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere which wilt lineendhere thou be , lineendhere base or brave? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with morn , climb , or , with night , skulk down the lineendhere skies to grope in caverns , or beneath the wave , creep , till lineendhere aghast at monsters that arise? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the stars that calm the sailor , long sea -- swirled , lineendhere and canopy fond lovers from the world , and lineendhere those that lead the heart and spirit , blend . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lo , only in the things and thoughts that tend toward lineendhere love's high harmony , is truth unfurled; all else are lies , whence heart , soul , lineendhere mind are hurled back to the right -- to progress without end . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the stars lineendhere all chant lineendhere as one . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from out the depths lineendhere thy coast was lifted skyward for lineendhere humanity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thy life , once finny circlings lineendhere in the sea , is now the orbits of the starry lineendhere host , encircling god with trust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere be this thy boast , when the long line of ages , lineendhere passing thee , lifts each his heart and soul , and shouts with glee , "that lineendhere trust in him was sentinel on post . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on toward the senate scuds lineendhere a thunder -- rack -- nay , cyclone -- and the columns -- all star -- straight -- of freedom's lineendhere temple sway with the roof's flood -- weight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ye stalwarts who scorn lineendhere off a fate , pitch -- black , holding the lineendhere columns , let no sinew slack . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a crash and lineendhere through the roof , what lineendhere floods of hate ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still , ye budge not , for lineendhere "freedom ," your teeth grate , "shall lie no wreck lineendhere along the cyclone's track . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " oh , not for you was dark lineendhere the time to slumber , but to hold lineendhere freedom's columns all star -- plumb ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yours was a watery grave , but martyrdom and , lineendhere hence , your resurrection with the number , whose greatness greatens , as the ages lineendhere come to know why their pathway , no wrecks encumber . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o lineendhere bastile lineendhere builder ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere deliver thee , who , put lineendhere on freedom's back , would'st grab all things , lineendhere at which thy past -- eyes gaped . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere freedom would humor thee; lineendhere so , down he flopped on justice's lineendhere floor to watch thee build with blocks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o harvard of the lineendhere norton wreath of gold and pearled , lineendhere longfellow purple ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if eliott is a speck upon lineendhere your gown , it will wash off; it is no stain to hold , lineendhere for you had let him go for being old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your wisdom was confirmed when to lineendhere the crown , a'gainst good folks who , like elisha brown , fought lineendhere for their homes , he gave his name's renown . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for , from the smallest lineendhere bone , you reconstruct the lineendhere creature , tongue to tail . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tell us lineendhere what eliott lineendhere is . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no; tis the prehistoric monster , lineendhere known as tory , that devoured young nathan hale and , lineendhere where it crawled , spread horror's crimson zone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your heart is not lineendhere a traitor to lineendhere your mind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who , knowing innocence in danger , dares not turn his lineendhere eye , for fear of smirk , or stares , by other courts , is justice's statue lineendhere blind , that to the wall , not bench , should be assigned . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oft , precedent is folly with gray lineendhere hairs; so you , recalling junius , heard the prayers lineendhere of friendless stilow; then , what did you find? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a fellow man lineendhere doomed wrongfully to lineendhere die a felon's death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if such was stilow's fate , you saw , lineendhere the felon would have been the state; hence , turned from lineendhere precedent , demanding "why? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " justice , asleep in marble , lineendhere woke and straight unroofed the courthouse to lineendhere let down the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a dukedom , and not one lineendhere the worse for wear , has sims well earned by lineendhere service to the king . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the eagle with his eye lineendhere and pinion , trained for mateship with the lineendhere sun , twitched at a sting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere amazed to find a "cootie" on his wing , and lineendhere that the insect dreamed , it was ordained by race heredity to serve the lineendhere king -- he shook his plume and azured , unprofained . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in english nature , lineendhere did saint george prevail over lineendhere the dragon? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere maybe in the time when england knew not lineendhere poverty , nor crime , described by cobbett , who would not go lineendhere bail for falsehood , nor let truth remain in jail . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it must , then , lineendhere have renewed life from lineendhere its slime , for , oh ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through deeds , that turn the lineendhere blood to chyme and eyes white inward , lineendhere see him ride the gale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in english nature -- oh , lineendhere where now the saint -- the spirit , to lineendhere sublime conceptions , true? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere has good saint george , too woundful to renew lineendhere his conflict with the dragon of base taint , been caught lineendhere up by elias from earth's view? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how , else , the lineendhere dragon's rage in lineendhere irrestraint? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the dragon lineendhere is grim lineendhere greed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the saint's long spear , lineendhere that once transfixed it , lineendhere can no longer touch . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the dragon's lineendhere soarings cause the sun's lineendhere eclypse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is that thunder , lineendhere god's collapsing lineendhere skys? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a conflict , lineendhere this , refracted , cloud lineendhere to cloud ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where a lineendhere white lineendhere summit? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere under crimson lineendhere seas , and these still lineendhere hightening . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through far azure , peace lineendhere listens and , eager , peeps; lineendhere then , turns headbowed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the conflict circling lineendhere earth , all plains are ploughed new lineendhere rows of gulches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere can aught appease the lineendhere dragon with fiend thirst's lineendhere eternities for tongue ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun lineendhere might , if it were lineendhere well sloughed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the dragon , mounting , draws aloft earth's lineendhere slime with which to dim the all -- producing sun from broadening lineendhere light and warmth for every one; but , look ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the eagle , with the thirst lineendhere sublime of justice , that the right lineendhere on earth be done -- flashes and -- hark ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis lineendhere earth's te -- deum lineendhere chime ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the grace lineendhere to soul to scorn to lineendhere be mere thing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " i cried , lineendhere and they answered lineendhere me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what sayest thou , oh meadow , that lineendhere stretches so wide , so far , that none can say how many lineendhere thy misty marguerites are? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and what say ye , red roses , that lineendhere o'er the sun -- blanched wall from your high black -- shadowed lineendhere trellis like flame or blood -- drops fall? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "we are born , we are reared , and we linger lineendhere a various space and die; we dream , and are bright and lineendhere happy , but we cannot answer why . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " what sayest thou , oh shadow , that lineendhere from the dreaming hill all down the broadening lineendhere valley liest so sharp and still? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "we are born , we are reared , and we linger lineendhere a various space and die; we dream and are very happy , lineendhere but we cannot answer why . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere may thy passing joyous be to thy father , the lineendhere great sea , for the sun is getting stronger; earth hath need of lineendhere thee no longer; go , kind snow , god -- speed to thee ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i break the spirit's cloudy bands , a wanderer lineendhere in enchanted lands , i feel the sun upon my hands; and far lineendhere from care and strife the broad earth bids me forth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i rise lineendhere with lifted brow and lineendhere upward eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i bathe my spirit lineendhere in blue skies , and taste the lineendhere springs of life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is singing of birds in the deep wet woods , lineendhere in the heart of the listening solitudes , pewees , and thrushes , and sparrows , lineendhere not few , and all the notes of their throats are true . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the thrush from the innermost ash takes on a tender lineendhere dream of the treasured and gone; but the sparrow singeth with pride and lineendhere cheer of the might and light of the present and here . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is shining of flowers in the deep wet woods , lineendhere in the heart of the sensitive solitudes , the roseate bell and lineendhere the lily are there , and every leaf of their sheaf is fair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere careless and bold , without dream of woe , the lineendhere trilliums scatter their flags snow; but the pale wood -- daffodil covers her lineendhere face , agloom with the doom of a sorrowful race . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the vesper -- sparrow's song , the stress of yearning lineendhere notes that gush and stream , the lyric joy , the lineendhere tenderness , and once again the dream ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a touch of far -- off joy and power , a lineendhere something it is life to learn , comes back to earth , and one lineendhere short hour the glamours of the gods return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this life's old mood and cult of care falls lineendhere smitten by an older truth , and the gray world wins back lineendhere to her the rapture of her vanished youth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dead thoughts revive , and he that heeds shall hear , lineendhere as by a spirit led , a song among the golden lineendhere reeds: "the gods are vanished but not dead ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " for one short hour; unseen yet near , lineendhere they haunt us , a forgotten mood , a glory upon lineendhere mead and mere , a magic in the leafless wood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at morning we shall catch the glow of lineendhere dian's quiver on the hill , and somewhere in the glades lineendhere i know that pan is at his piping still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " now though no more by marsh or stream or dewy lineendhere forest sounds the secret reed -- for pan is gone -- ah yet , the lineendhere infinite dream still lives for them that heed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an old -- world joyousness supreme , the warmth lineendhere and glow of an immortal balm , the mood -- touch of the gods , the lineendhere endless dream , the high lethean calm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they see , wide on the eternal way , the lineendhere services of earth , the life of man; and , listening to the lineendhere magic cry they say: "it is the note of pan ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here the slim -- pinioned swallows sweep and pass down to lineendhere the far -- off river; the black crow with wise and wary visage to and fro lineendhere settles and stalks about the withered grass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here , too , the robins , lusty as of old , hunt lineendhere the waste grass for forage , or prolong from every quarter of lineendhere these fields the bold , blithe phrases of their never -- finished song . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the white -- throat's distant descant with slow stress note after lineendhere note upon the noonday falls , filling the leisured air at intervals lineendhere with his own mood of piercing pensiveness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grief was my master yesternight; lineendhere to -- morrow i may grieve again; but now along the lineendhere windy plain the clouds have taken flight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the roads far off are towered with dust; lineendhere the cherry -- blooms are swept and thinned; in yonder swaying elms lineendhere the wind is charging gust on gust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but here there is no stir at all; the lineendhere ministers of sun and shadow horde all the perfumes of lineendhere the meadow behind a grassy wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an infant rivulet wind -- free adown lineendhere the guarded hollow sets , over whose brink the violets lineendhere are nodding peacefully . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from pool to pool it prattles by; the lineendhere flashing swallows dip and pass , above the tufted marish lineendhere grass , and here at rest am i . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i care not for the old distress , lineendhere nor if to -- morrow bid me moan; to -- day is mine , and i lineendhere have known an hour of blessedness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i passed through the gates of the city , the lineendhere streets were strange and still , through the doors of the open lineendhere churches the organs were moaning shrill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i strayed through the midst lineendhere of the city like one lineendhere distracted or mad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " i kept saying , lineendhere and the very lineendhere word seemed sad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i passed through the gates of the city , lineendhere and i heard the small birds sing , i laid me down lineendhere in the meadows afar from the bell -- ringing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the depth and the bloom of the meadows lineendhere i lay on the earth's quiet breast , the poplar fanned me with shadows , lineendhere and the veery sang me to rest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blue , blue was the heaven lineendhere above me , and the earth green lineendhere at my feet; "oh , life ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " i kept saying , lineendhere and the very lineendhere word seemed sweet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high in the hills the solitary thrush tunes magically lineendhere his music of fine dreams , in briary dells , by boulder -- broken streams; and wide and far lineendhere on nebulous fields aflush the mellow morning gleams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the orange cone -- flowers purple -- bossed are there , the meadow's bold -- eyed lineendhere gypsies deep of hue , and slender hawkweed tall and softly fair , lineendhere and rosy tops of fleabane veiled with dew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dim surging motions and uneasy dreads scare the light lineendhere slumber from men's busy eyes , and parted lovers on their restless lineendhere beds toss and yearn out , and cannot sleep for sighs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , lineendhere the lineendhere distance ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blue lineendhere and broad and lineendhere dim ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere peace is not in lineendhere burgh or meadow , but lineendhere beyond the rim . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere aye , beyond it , far beyond it; follow lineendhere still my soul , till this earth is lost in heaven , lineendhere and thou feel'st the whole . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and yet a moment more , out of the silent wood , lineendhere as if from the closing door of another world and another lineendhere lovelier mood , hear'st thou the hermit pour -- so sweet ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- his golden lineendhere music , ghostly lineendhere beautiful . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but when the fourth day came -- at noon , the darkness and lineendhere the rain were by; the sunward roofs were steaming dry; and all the world lineendhere was flecked and strewn with shadows from a fleecy sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the haymakers were lineendhere forth and gone , and every lineendhere rillet laughed and shone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with a turn of his magical rod , lineendhere that extended and suddenly shone , from the round of his lineendhere glory some god looks forth and is gone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to the summit of heaven the clouds lineendhere are rolling aloft like steam; there's a break in their lineendhere infinite shrouds , and below it a gleam . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o'er the drift of the river a whiff lineendhere comes out from the blossoming shore; and the meadows are greening , lineendhere as if they never were green before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the islands are kindled with gold and lineendhere russet and emerald dye; and the interval lineendhere waters outrolled are more blue than the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from my feet to the heart of the hills the lineendhere spirits of may intervene , and a vapor of azure lineendhere distills like a breath on the opaline green . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- and then the chill and the shadow lineendhere decline , on the eyes of rejuvenate lineendhere men that were wide and divine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the full , clear moon uprose and spread her lineendhere cold , pale splendor o'er the sea; a light -- strewn path that seemed to lineendhere lead outward into eternity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere between the darkness and the gleam an lineendhere old -- world spell encompassed me: methought that in a godlike lineendhere dream i trod upon the sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what would'st thou have for easement after grief , when lineendhere the rude world hath used thee with despite , and care sits at thine elbow lineendhere day and night , filching thy pleasures like a subtle thief? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on such a day the shrunken stream spends lineendhere its last water and runs dry; clouds like far turrets in a lineendhere dream stand baseless in the burning sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on such a day at every rod lineendhere the toilers in the hay -- field halt , with dripping brows , and lineendhere the parched sod yields to the crushing foot like salt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i watch the swinging currents go far lineendhere down to where , enclosed and piled , the logs crowd , and the gatineau lineendhere comes rushing from the northern wild . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i see the long low point , where close the shore -- lines , lineendhere and the waters end , i watch the barges pass in rows lineendhere that vanish at the tapering bend . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i see no more the barges pass , nor lineendhere mark the ripple round the pier , and all the uproar , mass lineendhere on mass , falls dead upon a vacant ear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beyond the tumult of the mills , and all lineendhere the city's sound and strife , beyond the waste , beyond the lineendhere hills , i look far out and dream of life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere around the long low shanties , whose rough lines break lineendhere the sealed dreams of many an unnamed lake , already in the frost -- clear lineendhere morns awake the crash and thunder of the falling pines . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with what doubting eyes , oh sparrow , lineendhere thou regardest me , underneath yon spray of lineendhere yarrow , dipping cautiously . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fear me not , oh little sparrow , lineendhere bathe and never fear , for to me both pool and lineendhere yarrow and thyself are dear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and on beside lineendhere the river's sober edge a long lineendhere fresh field lies black . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beyond , low thickets gray and reddish stand , lineendhere stroked white with birch; and near at hand , over a little steel -- smooth pond , lineendhere hang multitudes of thin and withering sedge . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere across a waste and solitary rise a lineendhere ploughman urges his dull team , a stooped gray figure with prone brow that lineendhere plunges bending to the plough with strong , uneven steps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the stream rings and lineendhere re -- echoes with his lineendhere furious cries . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sometimes the lowing of a cow , lineendhere long -- drawn , comes from far off; and crows in strings pass lineendhere on the upper silences . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a flock of small gray goldfinches , lineendhere flown down with silvery twitterings , rustle lineendhere among the birch -- cones and are gone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was a bleak and sandy spot , and , all lineendhere about , the vacant plot was peopled and inhabited lineendhere by scores of mulleins long since dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there was no sound lineendhere about the wood save lineendhere the wind's secret stir . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i stood among the mullein -- stalks as still lineendhere as if myself had grown to be one of their sombre lineendhere company , a body without wish or will . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now overhead , where the rivulet loiters and lineendhere stops , the bittersweet hangs from the tops of the alders and cherries lineendhere its bunches of beautiful berries , orange and red . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the snowbirds flee , tossing up on the far lineendhere brown field , now flashing and now concealed , like fringes of spray that lineendhere vanish and gleam on the gray field of the sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere flickering light , come the last of the leaves lineendhere down borne , and patches of pale white corn in the wind complain , like lineendhere the slow rustle of rain noticed by night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere withered and thinned , the sentinel mullein looms , lineendhere with the pale gray shadowy plumes of the goldenrod; and the lineendhere milkweed opens its pod , tempting the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere aloft on the hill , a cloudrift opens and lineendhere shines through a break in its gorget of pines , and it dreams at my feet lineendhere in a sad , silvery sheet , utterly still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all things that be seem plunged into silence , distraught , lineendhere by some stern , some necessitous thought: it wraps and enthralls marsh , lineendhere meadow , and forest; and falls also on me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere along the narrow sandy height i watch them swiftly lineendhere come and go , or round the leafless wood , like flurries of wind -- driven snow , revolving in lineendhere perpetual flight , a changing multitude . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere white are the far -- off plains , and white the fading forests grow; lineendhere the wind dies out along the height , and denser still the snow , a gathering lineendhere weight on roof and tree , falls down scarce audibly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the road before me smooths and fills apace , and all lineendhere about the fences dwindle , and the hills are blotted slowly out; the lineendhere naked trees loom spectrally into the dim white sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the meadows and far -- sheeted streams lie still without a sound; lineendhere like some soft minister of dreams the snow -- fall hoods me round; in wood and lineendhere water , earth and air , a silence everywhere . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the evening deepens , and the gray folds closer earth lineendhere and sky; the world seems shrouded far away; its noises sleep , and i , as lineendhere secret as yon buried stream , plod dumbly on , and dream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from this windy bridge at rest , in some former lineendhere curious hour , we have watched the city's hue , all along the orange west , cupola lineendhere and pointed tower , darken into solid blue . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere subtly conscious , all awake , let lineendhere us clear our eyes , and break through the cloudy lineendhere chrysalis , see the wonder as it is . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere creeping by the sullen wall , we forego the power to lineendhere see , the threads that bind us to the all , god or the immensity; whereof lineendhere on the eternal road man is but a passing mode . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere up the fielded slopes at morn , where lineendhere light wefts of shadow pass , films upon the bending lineendhere corn , i shall sweep the purple grass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sun -- crowned heights and mossy woods , and lineendhere the outer solitudes , mountain -- valleys , dim with lineendhere pine , shall be home and haunt of mine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall search in crannied hollows , where the sunlight scarcely lineendhere follows , and the secret forest brook murmurs , and from nook to nook forever lineendhere downward curls and cools , frothing in the bouldered pools . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall stray by lineendhere many a stream , where lineendhere the half -- shut lilies gleam . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere napping out the sultry days in the quiet lineendhere secluded bays; where the tasseled rushes tower , lineendhere o'er the purple pickerel -- flower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall hear the grasshoppers lineendhere from the parched grass rehearse , and with drowsy note prolong lineendhere evermore the same thin song . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall hear the crickets tell stories by the humming lineendhere well , and mark the locust , with quaint eyes , caper in his cloak of gray like lineendhere a jester in disguise rattling by the dusty way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall dream by upland fences , where the season's wealth lineendhere condenses over many a weedy wreck , wild , uncared -- for , desert places , that sovereign lineendhere beauty loves to deck with her softest , dearest graces . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there the long year dreams lineendhere in quiet , and the summer's lineendhere strength runs riot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shall i not remember lineendhere these , deep in winter lineendhere reveries? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it holds lineendhere me lineendhere fast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a drifting , april , twilight sky , a wind which lineendhere blew the puddles dry , and slapped the river into waves that ran lineendhere and hid among the staves of an old wharf . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a watery light touched bleak the granite lineendhere bridge , and white without the slightest tinge of gold , lineendhere the city shivered in the cold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all day my thoughts lineendhere had lain as dead , unborn and lineendhere bursting in my head . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from time to time i wrote lineendhere a word which lines and circles lineendhere overscored . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my table seemed a lineendhere graveyard , full of coffins waiting lineendhere burial . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i seized these vile abortions , tore lineendhere them into jagged bits , and swore to be lineendhere the dupe of hope no more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere into the evening lineendhere straight i went , starved of a lineendhere day's accomplishment . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere unnoticing , i wandered where the city gave a lineendhere space for air , and on the bridge's parapet i leant , while lineendhere pallidly there set a dim , discouraged , worn -- out sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere behind me , where the tramways run , lineendhere blossomed bright lights , i turned to leave , when lineendhere someone plucked me by the sleeve . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "your pardon , sir , but i should lineendhere be most grateful could you lend to me a lineendhere carfare , i have lost my purse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the voice lineendhere was clear , concise , lineendhere and terse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i turned and met lineendhere the quiet gaze of strange lineendhere eyes flashing through the haze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like some spanish don , conferring lineendhere favours even when asking an alms , he lineendhere bowed again and waited . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but my pockets proved empty , lineendhere in vain i poked and shoved , no hidden penny lineendhere lurking there greeted my search . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "sir , i declare i have lineendhere no money , pray forgive , but let me lineendhere take you where you live . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and so we plodded lineendhere through the mire where street lamps lineendhere cast a wavering fire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i took no note of where we lineendhere went , his talk became the element wherein lineendhere my being swam , content . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it flashed like rapiers in the night lineendhere lit by uncertain candle -- light , when on some moon -- forsaken lineendhere sward a quarrel dies upon a sword . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it hacked and carved like a cutlass blade , and the lineendhere noise in the air the broad words made was the cry of the wind at a lineendhere window -- pane on an autumn night of sobbing rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i walked as though some lineendhere opiate had stung and dulled my lineendhere brain , a state acute and slumbrous . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we stopped , a lineendhere house stood silent , lineendhere dark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from the chimney , red lineendhere eyes sparked the gloom , and a cricket's lineendhere chirp filled all the room . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my host threw pine -- cones on the fire lineendhere and crimson and scarlet glowed the pyre wrapped lineendhere in the golden flame's desire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the chamber opened like an eye , as a lineendhere half -- melted cloud in a summer sky the soul of the house stood guessed , lineendhere and shy it peered at the stranger warily . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a little shop with lineendhere its various ware spread on lineendhere shelves with nicest care . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere pitchers , and jars , and jugs , and pots , pipkins , lineendhere and mugs , and many lots of lacquered canisters , black and lineendhere gold , like those in which chinese tea is sold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere chests , and puncheons , lineendhere kegs , and flasks , goblets , chalices , lineendhere firkins , and casks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in a corner three ancient lineendhere amphorae leaned against the wall , lineendhere like ships careened . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there was dusky blue of wedgewood lineendhere ware , the carved , white figures fluttering there like lineendhere leaves adrift upon the air . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere classic in touch , but lineendhere emasculate , the greek soul lineendhere grown effeminate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt , hand on heart , and lineendhere daintily spelt their love in flowers , brittle and bright , artificial lineendhere and fragile , which told aright the vows of an eighteenth -- century knight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cruder tones of old dutch jugs glared lineendhere from one shelf , where toby mugs endlessly drank the foaming ale , lineendhere its froth grown dusty , awaiting sale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "ah , i see ," lineendhere said i , "you deal lineendhere in pottery . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the old man lineendhere turned and looked lineendhere at me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shook his lineendhere head lineendhere gently . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then from under his cloak he took the lineendhere thing which i had wondered to see him bring guarded lineendhere so carefully from sight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old man smiled , "it has no sheath , 'twas a little lineendhere careless to have it beneath my cloak , for a jostle to my lineendhere arm would have resulted in serious harm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but it was so fine , lineendhere i could not wait , so i brought it lineendhere with me despite its state . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "an amateur of lineendhere arms ," i thought , "bringing home a lineendhere prize which he has bought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "you care lineendhere for this sort lineendhere of thing , dear sir? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "not in lineendhere the way which you lineendhere infer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i need lineendhere them in business , lineendhere that is all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and he lineendhere pointed his finger lineendhere at the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then i saw lineendhere what i had not lineendhere noticed before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the walls were hung with at least five lineendhere score of swords and daggers of every size which lineendhere nations of militant men could devise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere poisoned spears from tropic seas , that lineendhere natives , under banana trees , smear with lineendhere the juice of some deadly snake . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blood -- dipped arrows , which savages lineendhere make and tip with feathers , orange and green , a lineendhere quivering death , in harlequin sheen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high up , a fan of lineendhere glancing steel was formed of lineendhere claymores in a wheel . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere jewelled swords worn at kings' levees were suspended lineendhere next midshipmen's dirks , and these elbowed stilettos come from spain , lineendhere chased with some splendid hidalgo's name . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere foils with buttons broken or lineendhere lost lay heaped on a chair , among them tossed lineendhere the boarding -- pike of a privateer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere against the chimney leaned lineendhere a queer two -- handed weapon , with edges dull as lineendhere though from hacking on a skull . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rusted lineendhere blood corroded lineendhere it still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my host took up a paper lineendhere spill from a heap which lay in an earthen bowl , and lighted lineendhere it at a burning coal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at either end of the table , lineendhere tall wax candles were placed , each in a small , and slim , lineendhere and burnished candlestick of pewter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old man lit each wick , and the room leapt lineendhere more obviously upon my mind , and i could see lineendhere what the flickering fire had hid from me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my head grew dizzy , i seemed to hear a battle -- cry lineendhere from somewhere near , the clash of arms , and the squeal of balls , and lineendhere the echoless thud when a dead man falls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a smoky cloud had veiled the room , shot lineendhere through with lurid glares; the gloom pounded with shouts and dying lineendhere groans , with the drip of blood on cold , hard stones . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sabres and lances in streaks of light gleamed lineendhere through the smoke , and at my right a creese , like a licking serpent's lineendhere tongue , glittered an instant , while it stung . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere streams , and lineendhere points , and lines of lineendhere fire ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the livid steel , which man's lineendhere desire had forged and welded , lineendhere burned white and cold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nerveless and shaking , round and round , i stared at lineendhere the walls and at the ground , till the room spun like a whipping lineendhere top , and a stern voice in my ear said , "stop ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i sell lineendhere no tools for lineendhere murderers here . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of what lineendhere are you lineendhere thinking ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere please clear your lineendhere mind of such lineendhere imaginings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will lineendhere tell you lineendhere of these things . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he pushed me into a great chair of russet lineendhere leather , poked a flare of tumbling flame , with the old lineendhere long sword , up the chimney; but said no word . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere slowly he walked to lineendhere a distant shelf , and brought back a lineendhere crock of finest delf . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he rested a moment a blue -- veined lineendhere hand upon the cover , then cut a band of paper , lineendhere pasted neatly round , opened and poured . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a sliding sound came from beneath lineendhere his old white hands , and i saw a little lineendhere heap of sands , black and smooth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what could they lineendhere be: "pepper ," lineendhere i thought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he looked lineendhere at lineendhere me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "what you lineendhere see is poppy lineendhere seed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lethean lineendhere dreams for those in lineendhere need . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he took up the grains lineendhere with a gentle hand and sifted lineendhere them slowly like hour -- glass sand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on his old white finger lineendhere the almandine shot out its lineendhere rays , incarnadine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "visions lineendhere for those too tired lineendhere to sleep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these seeds cast lineendhere a film over lineendhere eyes which weep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no single soul lineendhere in the world could dwell , without lineendhere these poppy -- seeds i sell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " for a moment he lineendhere played with the shining stuff , passing lineendhere it through his fingers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere enough at last , he poured it back lineendhere into the china jar of holland blue , which lineendhere he carefully carried to its place . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , with a smile on his aged lineendhere face , he drew up a chair to the open lineendhere space 'twixt table and chimney . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "without preface , young man , lineendhere i will say that what you see is not the puzzle lineendhere you take it to be . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "but surely , sir , there is something lineendhere strange in a shop with goods at so wide a range each lineendhere from the other , as swords and seeds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your neighbours must lineendhere have greatly differing lineendhere needs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "my neighbours ," he said , and he lineendhere stroked his chin , "live everywhere lineendhere from here to pekin . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but you are wrong , my sort lineendhere of goods is but one thing lineendhere in all its moods . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he took a shagreen letter lineendhere case from his pocket , and with charming grace offered lineendhere me a printed card . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i read lineendhere the legend , lineendhere "ephraim bard . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dealer lineendhere in lineendhere words . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and lineendhere that lineendhere was all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i stared at the letters , lineendhere whimsical indeed , or was lineendhere it merely a jest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he answered my unasked request: lineendhere "all books are either dreams or swords , you can lineendhere cut , or you can drug , with words . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my firm is a very ancient lineendhere house , the entries on my books would rouse your wonder , lineendhere perhaps incredulity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i inherited from an ancestry stretching remotely lineendhere back and far , this business , and my clients are as were those of my grandfather's lineendhere days , writers of books , and poems , and plays . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my swords are tempered for every lineendhere speech , for fencing wit , or to carve a breach through lineendhere old abuses the world condones . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these are purchased by men who feel the lineendhere need of stabbing society's heel , which egotism has lineendhere brought them to think is set on their necks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have foils to pink an adversary lineendhere to quaint reply , and i have customers who buy scalpels lineendhere with which to dissect the brains and hearts of men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ultramundanes even lineendhere demand some finer kinds to open lineendhere their own souls and minds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the other lineendhere half of my business deals with lineendhere visions and fancies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere under seals , sorted , lineendhere and placed in vessels here , i keep the seeds lineendhere of an atmosphere . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere each jar contains lineendhere a different kind of lineendhere poppy seed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from farthest ind come the purple flowers , lineendhere opium filled , from which the weirdest myths are distilled; my lineendhere orient porcelains contain them all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere every castle of the air sleeps in the lineendhere fine black grains , and there are seeds for every romance , lineendhere or light whiff of a dream for a summer night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i supply to lineendhere every want lineendhere and taste . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 'twas slowly said , in no lineendhere great haste he seemed to push his wares , lineendhere but i dumfounded listened . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by and by lineendhere a log on the lineendhere fire broke in two . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he looked lineendhere up quickly , "sir , lineendhere and you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " i groped for something lineendhere i should say; amazement lineendhere held me numb . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "to -- day you sweated lineendhere at a fruitless lineendhere task . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he spoke lineendhere for me , "what do lineendhere you ask? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how lineendhere can i serve lineendhere you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "my kind host , my lineendhere penniless state was not a boast; i lineendhere have no money with me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "not for that money lineendhere i beguiled you here; you lineendhere paid me in advance . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " again i felt as lineendhere though a trance had dimmed lineendhere my faculties . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere again he lineendhere spoke , and this time lineendhere to explain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "the money i demand lineendhere is life , your nervous force , lineendhere your joy , your strife ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " what infamous lineendhere proposal now was made lineendhere me with so calm a brow? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bursting through my lethargy , lineendhere indignantly i hurled the cry: "is this a nightmare , lineendhere or am i drunk with some infernal wine? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am no lineendhere faust , and what is mine is lineendhere what i call my soul ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere devil lineendhere or lineendhere ghost ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your hellish lineendhere plan revolts lineendhere me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "my child ," and the old tones were very lineendhere mild , "i have no wish to barter souls; my traffic lineendhere does not ask such tolls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am lineendhere no devil; lineendhere is there one? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere surely lineendhere the age of lineendhere fear is gone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we live within a daylight world lit by lineendhere the sun , where winds unfurled sweep clouds to scatter pattering lineendhere rain , and then blow back the sun again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i sell my fancies , or my swords , to those lineendhere who care far more for words , ideas , of which they lineendhere are the sign , than any other life -- design . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i claim for all the goods i lineendhere sell that they will serve their purpose well , lineendhere and though you perish , they will live . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere full measure lineendhere for your pay lineendhere i give . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to -- day you lineendhere worked , you lineendhere thought , in vain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what since has happened lineendhere is the train your toiling lineendhere brought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i spoke to you lineendhere for my share of the lineendhere bargain , due . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and is lineendhere that all you crave lineendhere in pay? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineendhere even lineendhere childhood gave ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have lineendhere been dedicate lineendhere from youth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere before my lineendhere god i speak lineendhere the truth ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " fatigue , excitement lineendhere of the past few hours broke me lineendhere down at last . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all day i had lineendhere forgot to eat , my nerves betrayed lineendhere me , lacking meat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i bowed my head and lineendhere felt the storm plough shattering lineendhere through my prostrate form . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere tearless sobs lineendhere tore at my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my host withdrew himself apart; lineendhere busied among his crockery , he paid lineendhere no farther heed to me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere exhausted , spent , i lineendhere huddled there , within the arms lineendhere of the old carved chair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a long half -- hour dragged away , and then lineendhere i heard a kind voice say , "the day will soon be dawning , when lineendhere you must begin to work again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here are the lineendhere things which you lineendhere require . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " by the fading light of the dying lineendhere fire , and by the guttering candle's flare , lineendhere i saw the old man standing there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he handed me a lineendhere packet , tied with crimson lineendhere tape , and sealed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "inside are seeds of many differing lineendhere flowers , to occupy your utmost powers of storied vision , lineendhere and these swords are the finest which my shop affords . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere go home and use them; do lineendhere not spare yourself; let that lineendhere be all your care . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whatever you have means lineendhere to buy be very sure lineendhere i can supply . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he slowly walked to the window , lineendhere flung it open , and in the grey air rung the lineendhere sound of distant matin bells . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere took my lineendhere parcels . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , as tells an ancient mumbling lineendhere monk his beads , i tried to thank for his lineendhere courteous deeds my strange old friend . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "nay , do not talk ," he lineendhere urged me , "you have a long lineendhere walk before you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and gently sped upon my way i stumbled lineendhere out in the morning hush , as down the empty street a flush lineendhere ran level from the rising sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere another lineendhere day was just lineendhere begun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over the housetops , above the rotating chimney -- pots , lineendhere i have seen a shiver of amethyst , and blue and cinnamon have flickered lineendhere a moment , at the far end of a dusty street . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through sheeted rain has come a lustre lineendhere of crimson , and i have watched moonbeams hushed by lineendhere a film of palest green . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was lineendhere her wings , lineendhere goddess ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who stepped over the clouds , and lineendhere laid her rainbow feathers aslant on lineendhere the currents of the air . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i followed her for lineendhere long , with gazing eyes and lineendhere stumbling feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i followed , lineendhere and watched for the flashing lineendhere of her wings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the city lineendhere i found her , the narrow -- streeted lineendhere city . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the market -- place i lineendhere came upon her , bound lineendhere and trembling . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her fluted wings were fastened to lineendhere her sides with cords , she was naked and cold , for that lineendhere day the wind blew without sunshine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere men chaffered for her , they bargained lineendhere in silver and gold , in copper , in wheat , and lineendhere called their bids across the market -- place . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the tall yellow hollyhocks stand , lineendhere still and straight , with their round blossoms spread open , lineendhere in the quiet sunshine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and still is the old roman wall , rough lineendhere with jagged bits of flint , and jutting stones , old and lineendhere cragged , quite still in its antiquity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the pear -- trees press their branches against it , lineendhere and feeling it warm and kindly , the little lineendhere pears ripen to yellow and red . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they hang heavy , lineendhere bursting with juice , against lineendhere the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so lineendhere old , lineendhere so still ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sky lineendhere is lineendhere still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the clouds make no sound as they lineendhere slide away beyond the cathedral tower , lineendhere to the river , and the sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is lineendhere very quiet , very lineendhere sunny . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the myrtle flowers lineendhere stretch themselves in the sunshine , lineendhere but make no sound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the roses push their lineendhere little tendrils up , and climb lineendhere higher and higher . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in spots lineendhere they have climbed lineendhere over the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but they are very lineendhere still , they do not lineendhere seem to move . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the old wall carries them lineendhere without effort , and quietly ripens lineendhere and shields the vines and blossoms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a bird in a plane -- tree sings lineendhere a few notes , cadenced and perfect they lineendhere weave into the silence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cathedral lineendhere bell knocks , one , two , three , and again , lineendhere and then again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is a quiet sound , calling lineendhere to prayer , hardly scattering the stillness , only lineendhere making it close in more densely . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gardener lineendhere picks ripe gooseberries for the lineendhere dean's supper to -- night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is very quiet , lineendhere very regulated lineendhere and mellow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the wall lineendhere is old , it has known lineendhere many days . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is a roman lineendhere wall , left -- over and lineendhere forgotten . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beyond the cathedral lineendhere close yelp and mutter the discontents of lineendhere people not mellow , not well -- regulated . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere people who care more for bread than for beauty , lineendhere who would break the tombs of saints , and give the painted windows lineendhere of churches to their children for toys . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere people who lineendhere say: "they are dead , lineendhere we live ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the world is lineendhere for the lineendhere living . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is lineendhere always the lineendhere dead who breed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere crush the ripe fruit , and cast it lineendhere aside , yet its seeds shall fructify , and lineendhere trees rise where your huts were standing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the little lineendhere people are ignorant , lineendhere they chaffer , and swarm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they gnaw like rats , and lineendhere the foundations of the cathedral lineendhere are honeycombed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the dean is in the chapter house; he lineendhere is reading the architect's bill for the completed lineendhere restoration of the cathedral . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he will have ripe gooseberries for supper , and then he will walk lineendhere up and down the path by the wall , and admire the snapdragons and dahlias , lineendhere thinking how quiet and peaceful the garden is . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old wall will watch lineendhere him , very quietly and lineendhere patiently it will watch . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for the wall lineendhere is old , it is lineendhere a roman wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere spread on the roadway , with open -- blown lineendhere jackets , like black , soaring pinions , they swoop down lineendhere the hillside , the cyclists . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere seeming dark -- plumaged birds , after lineendhere carrion , careening and circling , lineendhere over the dying of england . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she lies with her bosom beneath lineendhere them , no longer the dominant mother , the lineendhere virile -- but rotting before time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the smell of lineendhere her , tainted , has lineendhere bitten their nostrils . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what charm is yours , you faded old -- world lineendhere tapestries , of outworn , childish mysteries , vague lineendhere pageants woven on a web of dream ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and we , pushing and fighting lineendhere in the turbid stream of modern life , find solace lineendhere in your tarnished broideries . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere old lichened halls , sun -- shaded by huge lineendhere cedar -- trees , the layered branches horizontal lineendhere stretched , like japanese dark -- banded prints . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere carven cathedrals , on a sky lineendhere of faintest colour , where the gothic spires fly lineendhere and sway like masts , against a shifting breeze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere worm -- eaten pages , clasped in lineendhere old brown vellum , shrunk from over -- handling , lineendhere by some anxious monk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or virgin's hours , bright with gold and graven lineendhere with flowers , and rare birds , and all the saints of heaven , and noah's lineendhere ark stuck on ararat , when all the world had sunk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they have watered the street , it shines in lineendhere the glare of lamps , cold , white lamps , and lies like a lineendhere slow -- moving river , barred with silver and black . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cabs go down it , lineendhere one , and then lineendhere another . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere between them i lineendhere hear the shuffling lineendhere of feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tramps doze on lineendhere the window -- ledges , night -- walkers pass along lineendhere the sidewalks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the city is squalid and lineendhere sinister , with the silver -- barred street in the lineendhere midst , slow -- moving , a river leading nowhere . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere opposite my window , lineendhere the moon cuts , clear and round , lineendhere through the plum -- coloured night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she cannot lineendhere light the city; lineendhere it is too bright . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it has lineendhere white lamps , and lineendhere glitters coldly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i stand in lineendhere the window and watch lineendhere the moon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is thin and lineendhere lustreless , but lineendhere i love her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i know the lineendhere moon , and this is an lineendhere alien city . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to ezra pound with much friendship and admiration lineendhere and some differences of opinion the poet took his lineendhere walking -- stick of fine and polished ebony . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere set in the close -- grained wood were quaint lineendhere devices; patterns in ambers , and lineendhere in the clouded green of jades . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the top was of smooth , yellow ivory , lineendhere and a tassel of tarnished gold hung by a faded cord from lineendhere a hole pierced in the hard wood , circled with silver . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for years the lineendhere poet had wrought upon lineendhere this cane . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his wealth had gone to enrich it , his lineendhere experiences to pattern it , his labour lineendhere to fashion and burnish it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to him it was perfect , lineendhere a work of art and a weapon , a lineendhere delight and a defence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poet lineendhere took his walking -- stick lineendhere and walked abroad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere peace be lineendhere with you , lineendhere brother . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poet lineendhere came to a lineendhere meadow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sifted through the grass lineendhere were daisies , open -- mouthed , wondering , lineendhere they gazed at the sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poet lineendhere struck them with his lineendhere cane . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the little heads flew off , and lineendhere they lay dying , open -- mouthed and lineendhere wondering , on the hard ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are not lineendhere roses ," said lineendhere the poet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poet lineendhere came to lineendhere a stream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere purple and blue flags waded in lineendhere the water; in among them hopped the speckled frogs; lineendhere the wind slid through them , rustling . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poet lifted his lineendhere cane , and the iris heads fell lineendhere into the water . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they floated lineendhere away , torn lineendhere and drowning . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "wretched flowers ," lineendhere said the poet , "they are lineendhere not roses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it lineendhere is your lineendhere affair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poet lineendhere came to a lineendhere garden . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dahlias ripened against a wall , gillyflowers lineendhere stood up bravely for all their short stature , and a trumpet -- vine covered lineendhere an arbour with the red and gold of its blossoms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere red and gold lineendhere like the brass notes lineendhere of trumpets . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poet knocked off the stiff heads lineendhere of the dahlias , and his cane lopped the lineendhere gillyflowers at the ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then he lineendhere severed the trumpet -- blossoms lineendhere from their stems . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere red and gold they lay scattered , lineendhere red and gold , as on a battle field; red lineendhere and gold , prone and dying . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "they were not lineendhere roses ," said lineendhere the poet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but behind you lineendhere is destruction , lineendhere and waste places . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the poet came home lineendhere at evening , and in the candle -- light he lineendhere wiped and polished his cane . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the orange candle flame leaped lineendhere in the yellow ambers , and made the jades lineendhere undulate like green pools . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it played along the lineendhere bright ebony , and glowed in lineendhere the top of cream -- coloured ivory . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but these things were lineendhere dead , only the candle -- light made lineendhere them seem to move . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "it is a pity lineendhere there were no roses ," lineendhere said the poet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he perches in lineendhere the slime , inert , bedaubed with lineendhere iridescent dirt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the ground is here lineendhere and there bestud with lumps lineendhere of only part -- burned coal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their sharp and glistening lineendhere edges cut his stiffened lineendhere fingers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through the smut lineendhere gleam red the wounds which lineendhere will not shut . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wet through and shivering lineendhere he kneels and digs the slippery coals; like lineendhere eels they slide about . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his force all lineendhere spent , he counts his small lineendhere accomplishment . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a half -- a -- dozen clinker -- coals which lineendhere still have fire lineendhere in their souls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and in his thought lineendhere there burns the topaz fire lineendhere of votive urns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he sees it fling lineendhere from hill to hill , and still consumed , lineendhere is burning still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere higher and higher lineendhere leaps the flame , the smoke an lineendhere ever -- shifting frame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he sees a spanish lineendhere castle old , with silver steps lineendhere and paths of gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from myrtle bowers comes the plash of lineendhere fountains , and the emerald flash of parrots in the lineendhere orange trees , whose blossoms pasture humming bees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he knows he feeds the urns whose smoke bears lineendhere visions , that his master -- stroke is out of dirt and misery lineendhere to light the fire of poesy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he sees the glory , lineendhere yet he knows that others cannot lineendhere see his shows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to them his smoke is sightless , black , his votive vessels lineendhere but a pack of old discarded shards , his fire a peddler's; still lineendhere to him the pyre is incensed , an enduring goal ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he sighs lineendhere and grubs another lineendhere coal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how should i sing when buffeting lineendhere salt waves and stung with bitter surges , in lineendhere whose might i toss , a cockleshell? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no parting cloud reveals a watery star , my lineendhere cries are washed away upon the wind , my cramped and blistering hands can find lineendhere no spar , my eyes with hope o'erstrained , are growing blind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but painted on the sky lineendhere great visions burn , my voice , oblation lineendhere from a shattered urn ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so up , and down , and forward , inch by lineendhere inch , he gains upon the shore , where poppies glow and lineendhere sandflies dance their little lives away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the stooping sky leans down upon the lineendhere hills and tenderly , as one who soothing stills an anguish , lineendhere gathers earth to lie embraced and girdled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do the lineendhere sun -- filled men feel patience lineendhere then? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere be lineendhere patient with lineendhere you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when pain's iron bars their rivets tighten , stern lineendhere to bend and break their victims; as they turn , hopeless , there stand the lineendhere purple jars of night to spill oblivion . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do these lineendhere men feel lineendhere patience then? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my sun lineendhere and lineendhere moon ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my lineendhere basketful lineendhere of flowers ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my money -- bag lineendhere of shining lineendhere dreams ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my hours , windless lineendhere and still , of lineendhere afternoon ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you are my world lineendhere and i your lineendhere citizen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what meaning lineendhere can have patience lineendhere then? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere be not angry with me that i bear your lineendhere colours everywhere , all through each crowded street , and meet the lineendhere wonder -- light in every eye , as i go by . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze , blinded lineendhere by rainbow haze , the stuff of happiness , no less , which wraps lineendhere me in its glad -- hued folds of peacock golds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere before my feet the lineendhere dusty , rough -- paved way flushes lineendhere beneath its gray . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my steps fall ringed with light , lineendhere so bright , it seems a myriad suns lineendhere are strown about the town . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere around me is the sound of steepled lineendhere bells , and rich perfumed smells hang like a wind -- forgotten cloud , and shroud lineendhere me from close contact with the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you blazon me lineendhere with jewelled lineendhere insignia . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a flaming lineendhere nebula rims in lineendhere my life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and yet you set lineendhere the word upon me , unconfessed lineendhere to go unguessed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i pray to be the tool which to your hand long lineendhere use has shaped and moulded till it be apt for your need , and , lineendhere unconsideringly , you take it for its service . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i demand to be forgotten in the woven strand lineendhere which grows the multi -- coloured tapestry of your bright life , and through its tissues lineendhere lie a hidden , strong , sustaining , grey -- toned band . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wish to dwell around your daylight dreams , the railing to lineendhere the stairway of the clouds , to guard your steps securely up , where streams a lineendhere faery moonshine washing pale the crowds of pointed stars . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere remember not lineendhere whereby you mount , protected , lineendhere to the far -- flung sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere before me lies a mass of shapeless lineendhere days , unseparated atoms , and i must sort lineendhere them apart and live them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sifted dust covers lineendhere the formless lineendhere heap . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere reprieves , delays , lineendhere there are none , lineendhere ever . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as a monk who prays the sliding beads lineendhere asunder , so i thrust each tasteless particle aside , and lineendhere just begin again the task which never stays . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i have known a glory lineendhere of great suns , when days flashed by , pulsing lineendhere with joy and fire ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere drunk bubbled wine in goblets lineendhere of desire , and felt the whipped lineendhere blood laughing as it runs ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere spilt is that liquor , my too lineendhere hasty hand threw down the cup , and lineendhere did not understand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dearest , forgive that lineendhere with my clumsy touch i lineendhere broke and bruised your rose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hardly could suppose it lineendhere were a thing so fragile that my lineendhere clutch could kill it , thus . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it stood so proudly up upon its stem , i knew lineendhere no thought of fear , and coming very near fell , overbalanced , lineendhere to your garment's hem , tearing it down . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , stooping , i upgather , lineendhere one by one , the crimson petals , all outspread lineendhere about my fall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they hold their lineendhere fragrance still , a blood -- red cone of lineendhere memory . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and with my words i carve a little jar to lineendhere keep their scented dust , which , opening , you must breathe to your soul , lineendhere and , breathing , know me far more grieved than you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an arid daylight shines along the beach dried to a grey lineendhere monotony of tone , and stranded jelly -- fish melt soft upon the sun -- baked pebbles , lineendhere far beyond their reach sparkles a wet , reviving sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here bleach the skeletons of fishes , every lineendhere bone polished and stark , like traceries of stone , the joints lineendhere and knuckles hardened each to each . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and they are dead while lineendhere waiting for the sea , the moon -- pursuing lineendhere sea , to come again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their hearts are lineendhere blown away on the lineendhere hot breeze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only the lineendhere shells and stones can wait lineendhere to be washed bright . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for living things , who lineendhere suffer pain , may not endure lineendhere till time can bring them ease . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere happiness , to lineendhere some , elation; is , to others , lineendhere mere stagnation . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere days of passive lineendhere somnolence , at its wildest , lineendhere indolence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hours of empty lineendhere quietness , no delight , and lineendhere no distress . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere happiness to me lineendhere is wine , effervescent , lineendhere superfine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere full of tang and fiery lineendhere pleasure , far too hot to leave me leisure for lineendhere a single thought beyond it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this the bond: it lineendhere means to give one's soul to lineendhere gain life's quintessence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere even pain pricks to livelier lineendhere living , then wakes the nerves to laugh again , rapture's lineendhere self is three parts sorrow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere although we must die lineendhere to -- morrow , losing every thought but this; lineendhere torn , triumphant , drowned in bliss . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere happiness: lineendhere we rarely lineendhere feel it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how long shall i tarnish lineendhere the mirror of life , a spatter of lineendhere rust on its polished steel ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the seasons reel lineendhere like a goaded lineendhere wheel . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere half -- numb , lineendhere half -- maddened , my days lineendhere are strife . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the night is sliding lineendhere towards the dawn , and upturned lineendhere hills crouch at autumn's knees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a torn moon flees through lineendhere the hemlock trees , the hours lineendhere have gnawed it to feed their spawn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere pursuing and jeering lineendhere the misshapen thing a rabble lineendhere of clouds flares out of the east . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like dogs unleashed after lineendhere a beast , they stream on the sky , lineendhere an outflung string . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a desolate wind , through the unpeopled dark , shakes the lineendhere bushes and whistles through empty nests , and the fierce unrests i keep lineendhere as guests crowd my brain with corpses , pallid and stark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere leave me in peace , o spectres , lineendhere who haunt my labouring mind , i lineendhere have fought and failed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have not quailed , lineendhere i was all unmailed and naked i lineendhere strove , 'tis my only vaunt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the moon drops into lineendhere the silver day as waking lineendhere out of her swoon she comes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hear the drums of lineendhere millenniums beating the mornings lineendhere i still must stay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the years i must watch go in and out , while i build lineendhere with water , and dig in air , and the trumpets blare hollow despair , lineendhere the shuddering trumpets of utter rout . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an atom tossed in lineendhere a chaos made of yeasting lineendhere worlds , which bubble and foam . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whence lineendhere have lineendhere i come? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what would lineendhere be lineendhere home? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere hear no lineendhere answer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i crave lineendhere to be lost like lineendhere a wind -- blown flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere pushed into nothingness by a breath , and lineendhere quench in a wreath of engulfing death this fight lineendhere for a god , or this devil's game . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there once was a man lineendhere whom the gods didn't love , and a lineendhere disagreeable man was he . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he loathed his neighbours , and his lineendhere neighbours hated him , and he lineendhere cursed eternally . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he damned the sun , and lineendhere he damned the stars , and he blasted lineendhere the winds in the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he sent to hell every lineendhere green , growing thing , and he raved at lineendhere the birds as they fly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his oaths were many , and his range was wide , lineendhere he swore in fancy ways; but his meaning was plain: that no lineendhere created thing was other than a hurt to his gaze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he dwelt all alone , underneath a leaning lineendhere hill , and windows toward the hill there were none , and on the other lineendhere side they were white -- washed thick , to keep out every spark of the sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when he went to market he lineendhere walked all the way blaspheming lineendhere at the path he trod . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he cursed at those he bought lineendhere of , and swore at those he sold to , by all lineendhere the names he knew of god . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for his heart was soured in lineendhere his weary old hide , and his hopes lineendhere had curdled in his breast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his friend had been untrue , lineendhere and his love had thrown him over for the lineendhere chinking money -- bags she liked best . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rats had devoured the contents of lineendhere his grain -- bin , the deer had trampled on his corn , his brook had shrivelled in lineendhere a summer drought , and his sheep had died unshorn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his hens wouldn't lay , and lineendhere his cow broke loose , and his old horse perished lineendhere of a colic . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the loft his wheat -- bags were lineendhere nibbled into holes by little , lineendhere glutton mice on a frolic . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so he slowly lost lineendhere all he ever had , and the blood lineendhere in his body dried . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shrunken and mean he lineendhere still lived on , and cursed that future lineendhere which had lied . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so he dug , and he lineendhere delved , with care and pain , and the veins in lineendhere his forehead stood taut . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the end of an hour , lineendhere when every bone cracked , he lineendhere gathered up what he had sought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a dim old vase of lineendhere crusted glass , prismed while it lineendhere lay buried deep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shifting reds and greens , like lineendhere a pigeon's neck , at the touch of lineendhere the sun began to leap . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was dull in the tree -- shade , but glowing in the light; lineendhere flashing like an opal -- stone , carved into a flagon; and the colours lineendhere glanced and ran , where at first there had seemed to be none . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it had handles on lineendhere each side to bear it up , and a belly lineendhere for the gurgling wine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere its neck was slender , lineendhere and its mouth was wide , and its lineendhere lip was curled and fine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then he carried it home , and lineendhere put it on a shelf , but it was lineendhere only grey in the gloom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so he fetched a pail , lineendhere and a bit of cloth , and he lineendhere went outside with a broom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old man forgot to swear , lineendhere watching its shadow grown a mammoth lineendhere size , dancing in the kitchen there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he forgot to revile lineendhere the sun next morning when he found his lineendhere vase afire in its light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and he carried it out lineendhere of the house that day , and kept it lineendhere close beside him until night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and so it lineendhere happened from day lineendhere to day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old man fed his lineendhere life on the beauty of his vase , lineendhere on its perfect shape . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and his soul lineendhere forgot its former lineendhere strife . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the village -- folk came lineendhere and begged to see the flagon which lineendhere was dug from the ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the old man never lineendhere thought of an oath , in his joy at lineendhere showing what he had found . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one day the master of the village lineendhere school passed him as he stooped at toil , hoeing for a bean -- row , and at lineendhere his side was the vase , on the turned -- up soil . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "my friend ," said the schoolmaster , pompous and lineendhere kind , "that's a valuable thing you have there , but it might get broken lineendhere out of doors , it should meet with the utmost care . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what are you lineendhere doing with lineendhere it out here? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "why , sir ," said the poor lineendhere old man , "i like to have it lineendhere about , do you see? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to be with lineendhere it all lineendhere i can . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "you will smash it ," said lineendhere the schoolmaster , sternly right , lineendhere "mark my words and see ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and he walked away , lineendhere while the old man looked at his treasure lineendhere despondingly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then he lineendhere smiled to himself , for lineendhere it was his ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he had lineendhere toiled for it , lineendhere and now he cared . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere loved its shape , and lineendhere its subtle , swift hues , which his lineendhere own hard work had bared . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he would carry it lineendhere round with him everywhere , as lineendhere it gave him joy to do . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a fragile lineendhere vase should not stand in lineendhere a bean -- row ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who would dare lineendhere to say lineendhere so? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then his heart was rested , lineendhere and his fears gave way , and he bent lineendhere to his hoe again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a clod rolled down , and lineendhere his foot slipped back , and he lurched lineendhere with a cry of pain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for the blade of the hoe crashed lineendhere into glass , and the vase fell to lineendhere iridescent sherds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old lineendhere man's body heaved with slow , lineendhere dry sobs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he did lineendhere not curse , he had lineendhere no words . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he gathered the fragments , lineendhere one by one , and his fingers lineendhere were cut and torn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then he made a hole lineendhere in the very place whence the lineendhere beautiful vase had been borne . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he covered the hole , and he lineendhere patted it down , then he hobbled to lineendhere his house and shut the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he tore up his coat and lineendhere nailed it at the windows that no lineendhere beam of light should cross the floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he sat down in front lineendhere of the empty hearth , and he lineendhere neither ate nor drank . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in three days they found lineendhere him , dead and cold , and they said: lineendhere "what a queer old crank ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " have lineendhere at you , you lineendhere devils ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my back's to this tree , for lineendhere you're nothing so nice that the hind -- side of lineendhere me would escape your assault . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere come lineendhere on now , lineendhere all three ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here's a dandified gentleman , lineendhere rapier at point , and a wrist which whirls lineendhere round like a circular joint . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that's just to lineendhere anoint and make supple lineendhere your limbs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis a pity lineendhere the silk of your waistcoat lineendhere is stained . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your heart's full of lineendhere milk , and so full , lineendhere it spills over ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'm lineendhere not of lineendhere your ilk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you said so , and laughed at lineendhere my old -- fashioned hose , at the cut of my hair , lineendhere at the length of my nose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to carve it lineendhere to pattern i lineendhere think you propose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your pardon , young sir , but lineendhere my nose and my sword are proving themselves lineendhere in quite perfect accord . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i grieve to lineendhere have spotted lineendhere your shirt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that blade's not a stick to slash lineendhere right and left , and my skull is too thick to lineendhere be cleft with such cuffs of a sword . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now a lineendhere lick down the side lineendhere of your face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what a lineendhere pretty , red lineendhere line ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tell the taverns lineendhere that scar was an lineendhere honour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere don't whine that lineendhere a stranger lineendhere has marked you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere tree's there , you lineendhere swine ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere did you think to get in lineendhere at the back , while your friends made a little lineendhere diversion in front? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so it ends , with lineendhere your sword clattering lineendhere down on the ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis amends i make for your lineendhere courteous reception of me , a foreigner , lineendhere landed from over the sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your welcome lineendhere was fervent i lineendhere think you'll agree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my shoes are not buckled with gold , nor my lineendhere hair oiled and scented , my jacket's not satin , i wear corded lineendhere breeches , wide hats , and i make people stare ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so i do , but my heart is the heart of lineendhere a man , and my thoughts cannot twirl in the limited span 'twixt lineendhere my head and my heels , as some other men's can . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have business more strange than the shape of my lineendhere boots , and my interests range from the sky , to the roots of this lineendhere dung -- hill you live in , you half -- rotted shoots of a mouldering tree ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here's lineendhere at you , lineendhere once more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you can show me the lineendhere door , and jeer at my ways , but lineendhere you're pinked to the core . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and before i have done , i will lineendhere prick my name in with the front of my steel , and your lily -- white lineendhere skin shall be printed with me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for lineendhere i've come here lineendhere to win ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my cup is empty to -- night , lineendhere cold and dry are its sides , chilled by the lineendhere wind from the open window . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere empty and lineendhere void , it sparkles white lineendhere in the moonlight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the room is filled with lineendhere the strange scent of wistaria lineendhere blossoms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they sway in the lineendhere moon's radiance and tap lineendhere against the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the cup of my lineendhere heart is still , and cold , lineendhere and empty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when you come , it brims red and trembling lineendhere with blood , heart's blood for your drinking; to fill your mouth lineendhere with love and the bitter -- sweet taste of a soul . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my words are little lineendhere jars for you to take and lineendhere put upon a shelf . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their shapes are quaint and beautiful , lineendhere and they have many pleasant colours and lustres lineendhere to recommend them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere also the scent from them lineendhere fills the room with sweetness of lineendhere flowers and crushed grasses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you glow in my heart lineendhere like the flames of lineendhere uncounted candles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but when i go to warm my hands , my lineendhere clumsiness overturns the light , and then i stumble lineendhere against the tables and chairs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere outside the long window , with lineendhere his head on the stone sill , the dog is lineendhere lying , gazing at his beloved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his eyes are wet lineendhere and urgent , and his body lineendhere is taut and shaking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is cold on the terrace; a pale lineendhere wind licks along the stone slabs , but the dog gazes lineendhere through the glass and is content . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the beloved lineendhere is writing a lineendhere letter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere occasionally lineendhere she speaks to the dog , but she is lineendhere thinking of her writing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere does she , too , lineendhere give her devotion to lineendhere one not worthy? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere licking passions have bitten their arabesques lineendhere into it , and the mark of them lies , in and out , worm -- like , with the beauty lineendhere of corroded copper patterning white steel . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my brain is curved like a lineendhere scimitar , and sighs at its cutting lineendhere like a sickle mowing grass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but of what lineendhere use is all lineendhere this to me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i , who am lineendhere set to crack stones in a lineendhere country lane ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my heart is like a cleft lineendhere pomegranate bleeding crimson seeds lineendhere and dripping them on the ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my heart gapes because lineendhere it is ripe and over -- full , and its lineendhere seeds are bursting from it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but how is lineendhere this other than a lineendhere torment to me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i , who am shut lineendhere up , with broken crockery , lineendhere in a dark closet ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have been temperate lineendhere always , but i am like to be lineendhere very drunk with your coming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there have been times i feared to walk down lineendhere the street lest i should reel with the wine of you , and lineendhere jerk against my neighbours as they go by . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will mix me a drink of stars , -- large stars lineendhere with polychrome needles , small stars jetting maroon lineendhere and crimson , cool , quiet , green stars . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it will lap and scratch as i swallow lineendhere it down; and i shall feel it as a serpent of lineendhere fire , coiling and twisting in my belly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rain gullies the garden lineendhere paths and tinkles on the broad lineendhere sides of grass blades . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a tree , at lineendhere the end of my arm , lineendhere is hazy with mist . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere even so , i can see lineendhere that it has red berries , a scarlet fruit , lineendhere filmed over with moisture . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it seems as though the rain , lineendhere dripping from it , should be lineendhere tinged with colour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i desire the berries , lineendhere but , in the mist , i only scratch lineendhere my hand on the thorns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere probably , lineendhere too , they are lineendhere bitter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hold your apron wide that i may pour my lineendhere gifts into it , so that scarcely shall your two arms lineendhere hinder them from falling to the ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i would pour them upon you and lineendhere cover you , for greatly do i feel this need of giving lineendhere you something , even these poor things . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dearest lineendhere of my lineendhere heart ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i go away lineendhere from you the world beats dead like lineendhere a slackened drum . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i call out for you against lineendhere the jutted stars and shout into lineendhere the ridges of the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere streets coming fast , one after the other , wedge lineendhere you away from me , and the lamps of the city prick my lineendhere eyes so that i can no longer see your face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why should i leave you , lineendhere to wound myself upon the sharp lineendhere edges of the night? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hold your soul lineendhere open for my lineendhere welcoming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let the quiet of your spirit bathe me with lineendhere its clear and rippled coolness , that , loose -- limbed and weary , i find rest , outstretched lineendhere upon your peace , as on a bed of ivory . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere between us lineendhere leapt a gold and lineendhere scarlet flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere into the hollow lineendhere of the cupped , arched blue of lineendhere heaven it rose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere its flickering lineendhere tongues up -- drew and vanished lineendhere in the sunshine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how it came we lineendhere guessed not , nor what thing could lineendhere be its name . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from each to each had lineendhere sprung those sparks which flew together lineendhere into fire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but we knew the lineendhere winds would slap and quench lineendhere it in their game . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and so we graved and fashioned lineendhere marble blocks to treasure it , and placed lineendhere them round about . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with pillared porticos lineendhere we wreathed the whole , and roofed lineendhere it with bright bronze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere behind carved lineendhere locks flowered the tall lineendhere and sheltered flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere without , the baffled lineendhere winds thrust at a column's lineendhere bole . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beneath this sod lie lineendhere the remains of one who lineendhere died of growing pains . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you ask lineendhere me for a lineendhere sonnet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , my dear , can lineendhere clocks tick back to yesterday lineendhere at noon? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere can cracked and fallen leaves lineendhere recall last june and leap up on lineendhere the boughs , now stiff and sere? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yes , lineendhere 'tis lineendhere that ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my shadow stretches forward , lineendhere and the ground is dark in front because lineendhere the light's behind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is grotesque , with such a funny lineendhere hat , in watching it and walking i have found more lineendhere than enough to occupy my mind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i cannot lineendhere turn , the light would lineendhere make me blind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 1 a yellow band of light upon the street lineendhere pours from an open door , and makes a wide pathway of bright gold lineendhere across a sheet of calm and liquid moonshine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from inside come shouts and streams of laughter , and lineendhere a snatch of song , soon drowned and lost again in mirth , the clip of tankards lineendhere on a table top , and stir of booted heels . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere against the patch of candle -- light lineendhere a shadow falls , its girth proclaims the host lineendhere himself , and master of his shop . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 2 this is the tavern lineendhere of one hilverdink , jan hilverdink , lineendhere whose wines are much esteemed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere within his cellar men can have to drink the rarest lineendhere cordials old monks ever schemed to coax from pulpy grapes , and with nice art lineendhere improve and spice their virgin juiciness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here froths the amber beer of many a brew , crowning lineendhere each pewter tankard with as smart a cap as ever in his wantonness lineendhere winter set glittering on top of an old yew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 3 tall candles stand upon the lineendhere table , where are twisted glasses , ruby -- sparked lineendhere with wine , clarets and ports . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere those topaz bumpers lineendhere were drained from slim , long -- necked bottles lineendhere of the rhine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the centre of the board is piled lineendhere with pipes , slender and clean , the still unbaptized lineendhere clay awaits its burning fate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere behind , the vault stretches from dim to dark , a lineendhere groping way bordered by casks and puncheons , whose brass stripes and lineendhere bands gleam dully still , beyond the gay tumult . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 4 "for good lineendhere old master lineendhere hilverdink , a toast ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " clamoured lineendhere a youth with tassels lineendhere on his boots . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "bring out your oldest brandy lineendhere for a boast , from that small barrel in the lineendhere very roots of your deep cellar , man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why lineendhere here is lineendhere max ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere welcome , lineendhere max , you're scarcely lineendhere here in time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we want to drink to old lineendhere jan's luck , and smoke his best tobacco lineendhere for a grand climax . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here , jan , a paper , fragrant lineendhere as crushed thyme , we'll have the best to wish lineendhere you luck , or may we choke ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 5 max breuck unclasped lineendhere his broadcloth cloak , lineendhere and sat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "well thought lineendhere of , franz; here's luck to mynheer lineendhere jan . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the host set down a jar; lineendhere then to a vat lost in the distance lineendhere of his cellar , ran . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max took a pipe as graceful as the lineendhere stem of some long tulip , crammed it full , and drew the pungent lineendhere smoke deep to his grateful lung . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it curled all blue throughout lineendhere the cave and flew into lineendhere the silver night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at once there flung into the crowded shop lineendhere a boy , who cried to them: 6 "oh , sirs , is there some learned lineendhere lawyer here , some advocate , or all -- wise counsellor? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my master sent me to inquire lineendhere where such men do mostly be , but every door lineendhere was shut and barred , for late has grown the hour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i pray you tell me where i lineendhere may now find one versed in law , the lineendhere matter will not wait . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "i am a lawyer , lineendhere boy ," said max , "my mind is not locked to lineendhere my business , though 'tis late . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall be glad lineendhere to serve what way is in lineendhere my power . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 7 then once more , cloaked and ready , he set out , lineendhere tripping the footsteps of the eager boy along the dappled cobbles , lineendhere while the rout within the tavern jeered at his employ . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through new -- burst elm leaves filtered the white moon , who peered and splashed lineendhere between the twinkling boughs , flooded the open spaces , and took flight before lineendhere tall , serried houses in platoon , guarded by shadows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere past the custom house lineendhere they took their hurried way lineendhere in the spring -- scented night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 8 before a lineendhere door which fronted a canal lineendhere the boy halted . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a dim lineendhere tree -- shaded lineendhere spot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the water lapped the stones in lineendhere musical and rhythmic tappings , and a galliot slumbered lineendhere at anchor with no light aboard . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the boy lineendhere knocked twice , and steps lineendhere approached . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a flame winked through the keyhole , then a lineendhere key was turned , and through the open door max went toward lineendhere another door , whence sound of voices came . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he entered a lineendhere large room where lineendhere candelabra burned . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 9 an aged man lineendhere in quilted dressing gown lineendhere rose up to greet him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "sir ," said max , "you sent your lineendhere messenger to seek throughout lineendhere the town a lawyer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have small accomplishment , lineendhere but i am at your service , and my lineendhere name is max breuck , counsellor , at your command . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "mynheer ," replied the lineendhere aged man , "obliged am i , lineendhere and count myself much privileged . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am cornelius lineendhere kurler , and my fame is better known lineendhere on distant oceans than on land . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 10 my ship has tasted lineendhere water in strange seas , and bartered goods lineendhere at still uncharted isles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she's oft coquetted with lineendhere a tropic breeze , and sheered off lineendhere hurricanes with jaunty smiles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "tush , kurler ," here broke in the lineendhere other man , "enough of poetry , lineendhere draw the deed and sign . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the old man seemed to lineendhere wizen at the voice , "my good friend , grootver , -- " lineendhere he at once began . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "no introductions , let lineendhere us have some wine , and business , now that lineendhere you at last have made your choice . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 11 a harsh and lineendhere disagreeable man he proved to be , this grootver , lineendhere with no single kindly thought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere kurler explained , lineendhere his old hands nervously lineendhere twisting his beard . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his vessel lineendhere he had bought from lineendhere grootver . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 12 little by little lineendhere max made out the way that grootver lineendhere pressed that poor harassed old man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his money he must have , lineendhere too long delay had turned the usurer lineendhere to a ruffian . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 13 such light and foamy silks , like crinkled cream , and lineendhere indigo more blue than sun -- whipped seas , spices and fragrant trees , a massive beam of lineendhere sandalwood , and pungent china teas , tobacco , coffee ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " grootver lineendhere only lineendhere laughed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max heard it all , and lineendhere worse than all he heard the deed to lineendhere which the sailor gave his word . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he shivered , 'twas as if the villain lineendhere gaffed the old man with a boat -- hook; bleeding , spent , he begged for lineendhere life nor knew at all the road he went . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 14 for kurler had lineendhere a daughter , young and gay , carefully reared lineendhere and shielded , rarely seen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but on one black and most unfriendly lineendhere day grootver had caught her as she passed between the lineendhere kitchen and the garden . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she had run in fear of him , his evil lineendhere leering eye , and when he came she , bolted in her room , lineendhere refused to show , though gave no reason why . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the spinning of her future lineendhere had begun , on quiet nights she heard lineendhere the whirring of her doom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 15 max mended an lineendhere old goosequill by the fire , loathing his lineendhere work , but seeing no thing to do . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he felt his hands were building lineendhere up the pyre to burn two souls , and seized with lineendhere vertigo he staggered to his chair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere before him lay white lineendhere paper still unspotted lineendhere by a crime . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "now , young man , write ," lineendhere said grootver in lineendhere his ear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "`if in two years my vessel should yet lineendhere stay from amsterdam , i give grootver , sometime a lineendhere friend , my daughter for his lawful wife . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 16 and kurler swore , a palsied , lineendhere tottering sound , and traced his name , a lineendhere shaking , wandering line . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then dazed lineendhere he sat there , speechless lineendhere from his wound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grootver got lineendhere up: "fair voyage , lineendhere the brigantine ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he shuffled lineendhere from the room , and left lineendhere the house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his footsteps wore lineendhere to silence down lineendhere the street . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at last the lineendhere aged man began lineendhere to rouse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with help he once lineendhere more gained his trembling lineendhere feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "my daughter , lineendhere mynheer breuck , is friendless lineendhere now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere will lineendhere you watch over lineendhere her? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i ask lineendhere a solemn lineendhere vow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 17 max laid his hand upon the old lineendhere man's arm , "before god , sir , i vow , when you are gone , so to protect lineendhere your daughter from all harm as one man may . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " thus sorrowful , forlorn , the situation lineendhere to max breuck appeared , he gave his promise almost without lineendhere thought , nor looked to see a difficulty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "bred gently to watch a mother left alone; bound by lineendhere a dying father's wish , who feared the world's accustomed harshness when he should lineendhere be dead; 18 such was my case from youth , mynheer kurler . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere last winter she died also , and my lineendhere days are passed in work , lest i should grieve for her , and undo lineendhere habits used to earn her praise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my leisure i will gladly lineendhere give to see your household and your lineendhere daughter prosperous . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the sailor lineendhere said his thanks , but lineendhere turned away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he could not brook that his humility , lineendhere so little wonted , and so tremulous , should first before lineendhere a stranger make such great display . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 19 "come here to -- morrow as the bells lineendhere ring noon , i sail at the full sea , my daughter lineendhere then i will make known to you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'twill be a boon if after i have lineendhere bid good -- by , and when her eyeballs scorch with watching lineendhere me depart , you bring her home again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she lives with one lineendhere old serving -- woman , who has lineendhere brought her up . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but that lineendhere is no friend for so free lineendhere a heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no head lineendhere to match her lineendhere questions . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it lineendhere is lineendhere done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i must lineendhere sail away to come lineendhere and brim her cup . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 20 my ship's the fastest lineendhere that owns amsterdam as home , so not lineendhere a letter can you send . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall be back , before lineendhere to where i am another lineendhere ship could reach . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now your lineendhere stipend -- " quickly breuck lineendhere interposed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "when you once more lineendhere tread on the stones which lineendhere pave our streets . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to -- morrow i will be , lineendhere at stroke of noon , lineendhere at the great wharf . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " then hurrying , in spite of cake lineendhere and wine the old man pressed upon him ere he lineendhere went , he took his leave and shut the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 21 'twas noon in lineendhere amsterdam , the day was clear , and sunshine lineendhere tipped the pointed roofs with gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the brown canals ran liquid lineendhere bronze , for here the sun sank deep into lineendhere the waters cold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and every clock lineendhere and belfry in the town hammered , lineendhere and struck , and rang . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such peals of bells , to shake the sunny morning lineendhere into life , and to proclaim the middle , and the lineendhere crown , of this most sparkling daytime ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the crowd swells , laughing lineendhere and pushing toward the quays in lineendhere friendly strife . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 22 the "horn lineendhere of fortune" sails away lineendhere to -- day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at highest tide lineendhere she lets her anchor go , and lineendhere starts for china . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere giddy in freshest lineendhere paint she curtseys low , and beckons to lineendhere her boats to let her start . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blue is the lineendhere ocean , with a flashing lineendhere breeze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shining lineendhere waves are quick to take lineendhere her part . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they lineendhere push and spatter lineendhere her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her sails are loose , her tackles lineendhere hanging , waiting men to seize and haul lineendhere them taut , with chanty -- singing , as they choose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 23 at the great wharf's lineendhere edge mynheer kurler stands , and by his side , his lineendhere daughter , young christine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max breuck is there , lineendhere his hat held in his hands , bowing lineendhere before them both . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the brigantine bounces lineendhere impatient at the long delay , curvets lineendhere and jumps , a cable's length from shore . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a heavy galliot unloads on lineendhere the walls round , yellow cheeses , like gold cannon lineendhere balls stacked on the stones in pyramids . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once more kurler has lineendhere kissed christine , and now lineendhere he is away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 24 christine stood rigid like lineendhere a frozen stone , her hands wrung pale in lineendhere effort at control . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max moved aside and lineendhere let her be alone , for grief exacts each lineendhere penny of its toll . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the dancing lineendhere boat tossed on the glinting lineendhere sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a sun -- path swallowed it in flaming lineendhere light , then , shrunk a cockleshell , it came again lineendhere upon the other side . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now on the lineendhere lee it took the "horn lineendhere of fortune". lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere straining sight could see lineendhere it hauled aboard , men pulling lineendhere on the crane . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 25 then up above the eager lineendhere brigantine , along her slender masts , the sails took lineendhere flight , were sheeted home , and ropes were coiled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shine of the wet lineendhere anchor , when its heavy weight lineendhere rose splashing to the deck . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these things they saw , christine lineendhere and max , upon the lineendhere crowded quay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they saw the sails grow white , then blue in shade , the ship had lineendhere turned , caught in a windy flaw she glided imperceptibly away , lineendhere drew farther off and in the bright sky seemed to fade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 26 home , through the emptying lineendhere streets , max took christine , who would have hid lineendhere her sorrow from his gaze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere before the iron lineendhere gateway , clasped between each garden lineendhere wall , he stopped . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she , in amaze , asked , lineendhere "do you enter not lineendhere then , mynheer breuck? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my father lineendhere told me of your lineendhere courtesy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere since i am now your charge , 'tis meet for lineendhere me to show such hospitality as maiden may , lineendhere without disdaining rules must not be broke . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere katrina will lineendhere have coffee , and she lineendhere bakes today . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 27 she straight lineendhere unhasped the tall , beflowered lineendhere gate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max started at lineendhere the beauty , at lineendhere the glare of tints . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at either end was set a wide path lineendhere strewn with fine , red gravel , and such shows of tulips in lineendhere their splendour flaunted everywhere ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 28 from side to side , midway lineendhere each path , there ran a longer one which lineendhere cut the space in two . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then the dame katrina shook lineendhere them down , in pelting showers they plunged to earth , lineendhere and died transformed to sugared food . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 29 against the high , encircling lineendhere walls were grapes , nailed close to feel the baking of lineendhere the sun from glowing bricks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their microscopic lineendhere shapes half hidden by lineendhere serrated leaves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and one old cherry lineendhere tossed its branches lineendhere near the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bordered along the wall , in beds between , lineendhere flickering , streaming , nodding in the air , the pride of all the garden , lineendhere there were more tulips than max had ever dreamed or seen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they lineendhere jostled , mobbed , and lineendhere danced . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max stood lineendhere at helpless lineendhere stare . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 30 "within the arbour , mynheer breuck , i'll lineendhere bring coffee and cakes , a pipe , and father's best tobacco , brought from countries lineendhere harbouring dawn's earliest footstep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " with girlish zest lineendhere to please her guest lineendhere she flew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a moment more lineendhere she came again , with her lineendhere old nurse behind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , sitting on the bench and knitting fast , she talked lineendhere as someone with a noble store of hidden fancies , blown upon the lineendhere wind , eager to flutter forth and leave their silent past . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 31 the little apple lineendhere leaves above their heads let fall a lineendhere quivering sunshine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere quiet , lineendhere cool , in blossomed lineendhere boughs they sat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beyond , the beds of tulips blazed , lineendhere a proper vestibule and antechamber lineendhere to the rainbow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dyes of lineendhere prismed richness: lineendhere carmine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blues tinging lineendhere dark browns to lineendhere purple . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere silvers flushed lineendhere to amethyst lineendhere and tinct with gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere round eyes of lineendhere scarlet , spotting tender lineendhere saffron hues . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere violets sunk lineendhere to blacks , and reds in lineendhere orange crushed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 32 of every lineendhere pattern and in every lineendhere shade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nacreous , lineendhere iridescent , lineendhere mottled , checked . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere some purest sulphur -- yellow , lineendhere others made an ivory -- white lineendhere with disks of copper flecked . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sprinkled and lineendhere striped , tasselled , or keenest lineendhere edged . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere striated , powdered , lineendhere freckled , long or lineendhere short . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they bloomed , and seemed strange wonder -- moths lineendhere new -- fledged , born of the spectrum wedded lineendhere to a flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shade within the arbour lineendhere made a port to o'ertaxed eyes , its lineendhere still , green twilight rest became . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 33 her knitting -- needles clicked and lineendhere christine talked , this child matured to woman unaware , lineendhere the first time left alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now dreams lineendhere once balked found lineendhere utterance . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max thought her lineendhere very lineendhere fair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beneath her cap lineendhere her ornaments shone gold , and lineendhere purest gold they were . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere kurler lineendhere was rich lineendhere and heedful . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her old maiden lineendhere aunt had died whose darling lineendhere care she was . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , growing lineendhere bold , she asked , had max lineendhere a sister? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dropped a stitch lineendhere at her own lineendhere candour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then she lineendhere paused and softly lineendhere sighed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 34 two lineendhere years was lineendhere long ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she loved her lineendhere father well , but fears lineendhere she had not . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he had always lineendhere been just sailed or lineendhere sailing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and she must not dwell on lineendhere sad thoughts , he had told her so , and seen lineendhere her smile at parting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but lineendhere she sighed lineendhere once more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere two years was lineendhere long; 'twas not one hour lineendhere yet ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mynheer lineendhere grootver she would not lineendhere see at all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yes , yes , she knew , but ere lineendhere the date so set , the "horn of fortune" lineendhere would be at the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when max had lineendhere bid farewell , she lineendhere watched him from the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such things were christine's world , lineendhere and his was she winter drew near , lineendhere his sun was in her smiles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere another spring , and lineendhere at his law he toiled , unspoken hope lineendhere counselled a wise efficiency . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 36 max breuck was honour's soul , lineendhere he knew himself the guardian of lineendhere this girl; no more , no less . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as one in charge of guineas on a shelf lineendhere loose in a china teapot , may confess his need , but may lineendhere not borrow till his friend comes back to give . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so max , in honour , said no word lineendhere of love or marriage; but the days he lineendhere clipped off on his almanac . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere end must lineendhere come ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the second year , with feet lineendhere of lead , lagged slowly by till spring lineendhere had plumped the willow sprays . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 37 two years had made christine lineendhere a woman grown , with dignity and lineendhere gently certain pride . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but all her childhood lineendhere fancies had not flown , her thoughts in lovely lineendhere dreamings seemed to glide . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max was her trusted lineendhere friend , did she confess a closer lineendhere happiness? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max lineendhere could lineendhere not tell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere two years were over lineendhere and his life he found sphered lineendhere and complete . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in restless eagerness lineendhere he waited for the "horn lineendhere of fortune". lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere well had he lineendhere his promise kept , abating lineendhere not one pound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 38 spring lineendhere slipped away to lineendhere summer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still no lineendhere glass sighted the lineendhere brigantine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then grootver came lineendhere demanding jufvrouw lineendhere kurler . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his trespass lineendhere was justified , for he had lineendhere won the game . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere christine lineendhere begged time , more lineendhere time ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere midsummer went , lineendhere and grootver waxed lineendhere impatient . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere still lineendhere the ship lineendhere tarried . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere christine , betrayed lineendhere and weary , sank to lineendhere dreadful terrors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one day , lineendhere crazed , she sent lineendhere for max . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "come quickly ," said her lineendhere note , "i skip the worst distress lineendhere until we meet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere world is lineendhere blank . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 39 through the long lineendhere sunshine of late afternoon lineendhere max went to her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the pleached alley , lineendhere lost in bitter reverie , lineendhere he found her soon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and sitting down beside her , lineendhere at the cost of all his secret , "dear ," said he , "what thing lineendhere so suddenly has happened? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " then , in tears , she told that grootver , on the lineendhere following morn , would come to marry her , and shuddering: lineendhere "i will die rather , death has lesser fears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " max felt the shackles lineendhere drop from the oath which lineendhere he had sworn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 40 "my dearest lineendhere one , the hid joy lineendhere of my heart ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere love you , lineendhere oh ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you must lineendhere indeed have lineendhere known . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in strictest honour i have lineendhere played my part; but all this misery has lineendhere overthrown my scruples . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if you love me , marry lineendhere me before the sun has dipped lineendhere behind those trees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you cannot be wed lineendhere twice , and grootver , foiled , can lineendhere eat his anger . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my care it shall be to pay your lineendhere father's debt , by such degrees as i can compass , lineendhere and for years i've greatly toiled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 41 this is not haste , christine , lineendhere for long i've known my love , and silence lineendhere forced upon my lips . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i worship you with lineendhere all the strength i've shown lineendhere in keeping faith . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " with pleading lineendhere finger tips he lineendhere touched her arm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dearest , speak , lineendhere i love lineendhere you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do my words lineendhere fall too lineendhere swift now? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they've been lineendhere in leash so long upon lineendhere the brink . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " she sat quite lineendhere still , her body lineendhere loose and weak . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then into lineendhere him she melted , lineendhere all her soul at flow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 42 and they were married ere lineendhere the westering sun had disappeared lineendhere behind the garden trees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the evening poured on them its benison , and lineendhere flower -- scents , that only night -- time frees , rose up around them from the beamy lineendhere ground , silvered and shadowed by a tranquil moon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere within the arbour , long they lay embraced , in such lineendhere enraptured sweetness as they found close -- partnered each to each , and thinking soon to lineendhere be enwoven , long ere night to morning faced . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , far spent , our lineendhere eyes will close to lineendhere undisturbed rest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for that lineendhere desired thing i leave lineendhere you now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to pinnacle this day's accomplishment , lineendhere by telling grootver that a bootless quest is his , and lineendhere that his schemes have met a knock -- down blow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 44 but christine clung to lineendhere him with sobbing cries , pleading for love's lineendhere sake that he leave her not . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and wound her arms lineendhere about his knees and thighs as lineendhere he stood over her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with dread , begot of grootver's lineendhere name , and silence , and the night , lineendhere she shook and trembled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere words in moaning lineendhere plaint wooed him to lineendhere stay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she feared , lineendhere she knew not why , yet lineendhere greatly feared . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she seemed some lineendhere anguished saint martyred lineendhere by visions . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max breuck soothed her fright lineendhere with wisdom , then stepped out under lineendhere the cooling sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 45 but at the gate once lineendhere more she held him close and quenched her heart lineendhere again upon his lips . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "my sweetheart , lineendhere why this lineendhere terror? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i propose lineendhere but to be gone one lineendhere hour ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere evening slips away , lineendhere this errand must lineendhere be done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere first goes my lineendhere father , if i lose lineendhere you now ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " she grasped him lineendhere as in panic lest lineendhere she drown . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere softly he laughed , lineendhere "one hour through the lineendhere town by moonlight ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that's no place lineendhere for foul lineendhere attacks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dearest , be lineendhere comforted , and clear lineendhere that troubled brow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 46 one hour , lineendhere dear , and then , no more lineendhere alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we front lineendhere another day lineendhere as man and wife . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall be back almost lineendhere before i'm gone , and midnight shall anoint lineendhere and crown our life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " then lineendhere through the gate lineendhere he passed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere along the street lineendhere she watched his buttons lineendhere gleaming in the moon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he stopped to lineendhere wave and turned the lineendhere garden wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere straight she sank lineendhere down upon a lineendhere mossy seat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her senses , mist -- encircled by lineendhere a swoon , swayed to unconsciousness beneath lineendhere its wreathing pall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 47 briskly lineendhere max walked beside the still lineendhere canal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his step lineendhere was firm lineendhere with purpose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not a jot he feared this meeting , lineendhere nor the rancorous gall grootver would lineendhere spit on him who marred his plot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he dreaded no lineendhere man , since he could lineendhere protect christine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he stopped lineendhere and laughed lineendhere aloud . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his starved lineendhere life had not fitted him lineendhere for joy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it strained him to the lineendhere utmost to reject even lineendhere this hour with her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his lineendhere heart beat lineendhere loud . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "damn grootver , lineendhere who can force my lineendhere time to this employ ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what boyish lineendhere uncontrol to lineendhere be so racked . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then lineendhere felt his ticking lineendhere watch . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in half an lineendhere hour grootver would lineendhere know the whole . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and he would be returned , lifting lineendhere the latch of his own gate , eager to take lineendhere christine and crush her to his lips . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how lineendhere bear lineendhere delay? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he broke lineendhere into lineendhere a run . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in front , a lineendhere line of candle -- light banded the lineendhere cobbled street . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not for many a day lineendhere had he been there to take his lineendhere old , accustomed seat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and out lineendhere they came pell -- mell , his lineendhere old companions . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "max , lineendhere where have you lineendhere been? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not lineendhere drink with lineendhere us? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere indeed lineendhere you serve us lineendhere well ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how many lineendhere months is it since lineendhere we have seen you here? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere jan , jan , you lineendhere slow , old doddering lineendhere goat ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here's mynheer breuck come lineendhere back again at last , stir your lineendhere old bones to welcome him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fill your lineendhere throat; here's beer or lineendhere brandy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , boys , lineendhere hold him lineendhere fast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere put down lineendhere your cane , dear lineendhere man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what really lineendhere vicious lineendhere whacks ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 50 they forced him to a seat , lineendhere and held him there , despite his anger , while the lineendhere hideous joke was tossed from hand to hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere franz poured with care lineendhere a brimming glass lineendhere of whiskey . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "here , we've broke into lineendhere a virgin barrel lineendhere for you , drink ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere married , lineendhere and out lineendhere on business . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere which lie's lineendhere the lineendhere likeliest? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere come , max , lineendhere do lineendhere think . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " swollen with fury , struggling lineendhere with these men , max cursed hilarity lineendhere which must needs have a mark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 51 forcing himself to steadiness , lineendhere he tried to quell the uproar , told them what he dared lineendhere of his own life and circumstance . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere implied most urgent lineendhere matters , time could ill lineendhere be spared . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in jesting mood his lineendhere comrades heard his tale , lineendhere and scoffed at it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he felt his anger lineendhere more goaded and lineendhere bursting; -- "cowards ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is no one loth to mock lineendhere at duty -- " here they called for ale , lineendhere and forced a pipe upon him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with an oath he lineendhere shivered it to fragments on lineendhere the earthen floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 52 sobered a little by his violence , lineendhere and by the host who begged them to be still , nor injure his good name , "max , lineendhere no offence ," they blurted , "you may leave now if you will . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "we've gone lineendhere too lineendhere far . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i ask your lineendhere pardon for our lineendhere foolish joke . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it started in lineendhere a wager ere lineendhere you came . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the talk somehow had fall'n on drugs , a jar lineendhere i brought from china , herbs the natives smoke , was with me , lineendhere and i thought merely to play a game . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 53 its properties are to induce lineendhere a sleep fraught with adventure , and the flight of time is lineendhere inconceivable in swiftness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere deep sunken in slumber , lineendhere imageries sublime flatter the senses , or lineendhere some fearful dream holds them enmeshed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere years pass which on lineendhere the clock are but so lineendhere many seconds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we agreed that the lineendhere next man who came should prove the lineendhere scheme; and you were he . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and then the lineendhere pipe was broke , and you lineendhere were freed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " max breuck lineendhere was maddened lineendhere now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "another lineendhere jest of your lineendhere befuddled wits . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i know not lineendhere why i am lineendhere to be your butt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at my request you'll choose lineendhere among you one who'll answer for your most lineendhere unseasonable mirth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you'll lineendhere hear from lineendhere me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " but franz had caught him at the lineendhere very door , "it is no lie , max breuck , lineendhere and for your plight i am to blame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere come back , and lineendhere we'll talk lineendhere quietly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 55 you have no business , lineendhere that is why we laughed , since you had none lineendhere a few minutes ago . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as to your wedding , naturally lineendhere we chaffed , knowing the length of time it takes to do lineendhere a simple thing like that in this slow world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere indeed , lineendhere max , 'twas a lineendhere dream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere forgive lineendhere me lineendhere then . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll burn lineendhere the drug if lineendhere you prefer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " but breuck lineendhere muttered lineendhere and stared , -- "a lie . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and then he hurled , lineendhere distraught , this word lineendhere at franz: "prove it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and when it's lineendhere proven , i'll lineendhere believe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that thing lineendhere shall be lineendhere your work . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 56 i'll give you lineendhere just one week to make lineendhere your case . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on august thirty -- first , lineendhere eighteen -- fourteen , i shall require lineendhere your proof . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " with wondering face lineendhere franz cried , "a week to august , lineendhere and fourteen the year ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you're mad , lineendhere 'tis april lineendhere now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere april , lineendhere and lineendhere eighteen -- twelve . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " max staggered , lineendhere caught a chair , -- "april two lineendhere years ago ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere indeed , lineendhere or you , or lineendhere i , are mad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i know not lineendhere how either could blunder lineendhere so . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " hilverdink brought "the lineendhere amsterdam gazette", and max lineendhere was forced to read . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 57 "eighteen hundred lineendhere and twelve ," in largest print; and next to it , lineendhere "april the twenty -- first . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the letters smeared and jumbled , but by dint lineendhere of straining every nerve to meet the worst , he read it , and lineendhere into his pounding brain tumbled a horror . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like a roaring sea lineendhere foreboding shipwreck , came the message lineendhere plain: "this is two years ago ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineendhere of lineendhere christine? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he fled the cellar , in lineendhere his agony running to outstrip lineendhere fate , and save his holy shrine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 58 the darkened buildings lineendhere echoed to his feet clap -- clapping on the lineendhere pavement as he ran . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere across moon -- misted lineendhere squares clamoured his fleet lineendhere and terror -- winged steps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his heart lineendhere began to labour lineendhere at the speed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and still no sign , lineendhere no flutter of a lineendhere leaf against the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and this should be lineendhere the garden wall , and round the lineendhere corner , the old gate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no even lineendhere line was lineendhere this ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and then a lineendhere fearful cry shattered lineendhere the stillness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere two stiff lineendhere houses lineendhere filled the ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 59 shoulder to shoulder , like dragoons lineendhere in line , they stood , and max knew them to be the ones to lineendhere right and left of kurler's garden . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere spine rigid lineendhere next frozen lineendhere spine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no mellow tones of ancient gilded iron , lineendhere undulate , expanding in wide circles and broad curves , the lineendhere twisted iron of the garden gate , was there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the houses lineendhere touched and left no lineendhere space between . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with glassy lineendhere eyes and shaking nerves lineendhere max gazed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then mad with lineendhere fear , fled still , and lineendhere left that place . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 60 stumbling lineendhere and panting , on he ran , lineendhere and on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his slobbering lineendhere lips could only lineendhere cry , "christine ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where are lineendhere you lineendhere gone? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what future lineendhere is our lineendhere past? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what saturnine , sardonic lineendhere devil's jest has bid us live two years lineendhere together in a puff of smoke? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was lineendhere no dream , i lineendhere swear it ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in some star , or still lineendhere imprisoned in time's egg , lineendhere you give me love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dearest dear , this stroke lineendhere shall never part us , i lineendhere will reach to where you are . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 61 his lineendhere burning eyeballs stared into lineendhere the dark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the moon lineendhere had long lineendhere been set . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere still he lineendhere cried: "christine ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his youth had taught lineendhere their meaning , now they closed lineendhere upon his dream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 62 softly he knocked against the lineendhere casement , wide it flew , and a cracked voice his lineendhere business there demanded . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the door opened , lineendhere and inside lineendhere max stepped . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he saw a candle lineendhere held in air above the head lineendhere of a gray -- bearded jew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "simeon isaacs , lineendhere mynheer , can i lineendhere serve you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do lineendhere you lineendhere keep arms? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere want a lineendhere pistol . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " quick the lineendhere old man lineendhere grew livid . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "mynheer , lineendhere a lineendhere pistol ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let me swerve lineendhere you from your lineendhere purpose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere life brings often false alarms -- " lineendhere 63 "peace , good old isaacs , why should you suppose lineendhere my purpose deadly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in good truth lineendhere i've been blest above lineendhere others . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you have many lineendhere rows of pistols lineendhere it would seem . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here , this shagreen lineendhere case holds one that i lineendhere fancy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere silvered mounts lineendhere are to lineendhere my taste . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'twill serve my turn though -- " lineendhere hastily he counts the florins lineendhere down upon the table . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "well , good -- night , lineendhere and wish me luck for lineendhere your to -- morrow's toast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " 64 into the night again lineendhere he hurried , now pale and in haste; and far beyond lineendhere the town he set his goal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and then he lineendhere wondered how lineendhere poor c . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere had lineendhere come to lineendhere die . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "it's grown handy in lineendhere killing , maybe , this i've bought , and lineendhere will work punctually . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " his sorrow fell upon lineendhere his senses , shutting lineendhere out all else . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere again he wept , and lineendhere called , and blindly fought the heavy lineendhere miles away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my lineendhere own lineendhere wife ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he lurched lineendhere with failing lineendhere pulse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 65 along the dyke the lineendhere keen air blew in gusts , and grasses bent and lineendhere wailed before the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the zuider zee , which croons all night and lineendhere thrusts long stealthy fingers up some way to find and lineendhere crumble down the stones , moaned baffled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here the wide -- armed lineendhere windmills looked lineendhere like gallows -- trees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no lights lineendhere were burning in the lineendhere distant thorps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere max laid lineendhere aside lineendhere his coat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his mind , lineendhere half -- clear , babbled lineendhere "christine ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " a shot split lineendhere through the lineendhere breeze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cold stars winked lineendhere and glittered at his lineendhere chilling corpse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dear virgin mary , lineendhere far away , look down from heaven lineendhere while i pray . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere open your golden lineendhere casement high , and lean way out lineendhere beyond the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am so little , lineendhere it may be a task for you lineendhere to harken me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o lady mary , i lineendhere have bought a candle , as lineendhere the good priest taught . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i only had lineendhere one penny , so old goody jenkins lineendhere let it go . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is lineendhere a little lineendhere bent , you see . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but oh , lineendhere be merciful lineendhere to me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have not anything lineendhere to give , yet i so long lineendhere for him to live . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a year ago he sailed lineendhere away and not a word lineendhere unto today . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i've strained my eyes lineendhere from the sea -- wall but never lineendhere does he come at all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere other ships have entered port their lineendhere voyages finished , long or short , and other sailors have lineendhere received their welcomes , while i sat and grieved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my heart is bursting lineendhere for his hail , o virgin , lineendhere let me spy his sail . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _hull down on the edge of lineendhere a sun -- soaked sea sparkle the lineendhere bellying sails for me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere taut to the push of a rousing wind shaking the lineendhere sea till it foams behind , the tightened rigging is shrill with the lineendhere song: "we are back again who were gone so long . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "_ one lineendhere afternoon i lineendhere bumped my head . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i sat on a post and wished i lineendhere were dead like father and mother , for no one lineendhere cared whither i went or how i fared . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a man's voice said , "my lineendhere little lad , here's a bit of a lineendhere toy to make you glad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he held out his hand lineendhere and gave to me the most marvellous lineendhere top which could ever be . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it had ivory eyes , and jet -- black rings , and a lineendhere red stone carved into little wings , all joined by a twisted golden lineendhere line , and set in the brown wood , even and fine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it couldn't lineendhere mean quite the same to lineendhere you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere every day i lineendhere met him there , where the fisher -- nets lineendhere dry in the sunny air . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he told me stories lineendhere of courts and kings , of storms at lineendhere sea , of lots of things . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the top he said was lineendhere a sort of sign that something lineendhere in the big world was mine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _blue and white lineendhere on a sun -- shot lineendhere ocean . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere against the lineendhere horizon a lineendhere glint in motion . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere full in the grasp of a shoving wind , trailing lineendhere her bubbles of foam behind , singing and shouting to port she lineendhere races , a flying harp , with her sheets and braces . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _ o queen of heaven , lineendhere give me heed , i am in lineendhere very utmost need . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he loved me , he was all lineendhere i had , and when he came it made lineendhere the sad thoughts disappear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this very lineendhere day send his ship lineendhere home to me i pray . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll be a priest , if you want it so , i'll lineendhere work till i have enough to go and study latin to say lineendhere the prayers on the rosary our old priest wears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wished to be a lineendhere sailor too , but i will give lineendhere myself to you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll never even lineendhere spin my top , but put it away lineendhere in a box . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll stop lineendhere whistling the lineendhere sailor -- songs he taught . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll save my pennies till i have lineendhere bought a silver heart in the market square , i've seen lineendhere some beautiful , white ones there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll give up all i lineendhere want to do and do whatever lineendhere you tell me to . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere heavenly lady , take away lineendhere all the games i like to play , take my life to fill lineendhere the score , only bring him back once more ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _the poplars shiver and lineendhere turn their leaves , and the wind through lineendhere the belfry moans and grieves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gray dust whirls in the market lineendhere square , and the silver hearts are covered lineendhere with care by thick tarpaulins . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once again lineendhere the bay is black under lineendhere heavy rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _ the queen of lineendhere heaven has lineendhere shut her door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a little lineendhere boy weeps and lineendhere prays no more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but why lineendhere did i kill lineendhere him? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the lineendhere small , gilded lineendhere room , near the stair? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my ears rack and throb with his cry , and lineendhere his eyes goggle under his hair , as my fingers lineendhere sink into the fair white skin of his throat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere killed lineendhere him ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shook him until his red lineendhere tongue hung flapping out through the black , queer , lineendhere swollen lines of his lips . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i clung with my lineendhere nails drawing blood , while i flung the loose , lineendhere heavy body in fear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fear lest lineendhere he should still not lineendhere be dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i was drunk lineendhere with the lust lineendhere of his life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the blood -- drops oozed lineendhere slow from his head and dabbled lineendhere a chair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and our strife lasted lineendhere one reeling second , his knife lay lineendhere and winked in the lights overhead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the waltz from the lineendhere ballroom i heard , when i called lineendhere him a low , sneaking cur . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the wail of the lineendhere violins stirred my brute anger lineendhere with visions of her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as i throttled his windpipe , lineendhere the purr of his breath with the lineendhere waltz became blurred . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have ridden ten miles lineendhere through the dark , with that music , an infernal lineendhere din , pounding rhythmic inside me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and my fingers sink in to his lineendhere flesh when the violins , thin and straining lineendhere with passion , grow stark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , lineendhere the horror of lineendhere sound ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while she lineendhere danced i was crushing lineendhere his throat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he had tasted the joy lineendhere of her , wound round her body , and i heard lineendhere him gloat on the favour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that lineendhere instant lineendhere i smote . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how the lineendhere dancers swirl lineendhere round ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is here in the room , in my arm , lineendhere his limp body hangs on the spin of the waltz we are dancing , lineendhere a swarm of blood -- drops is hemming us in ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and his sin lineendhere is red like his tongue lineendhere lolling warm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the lineendhere drums are lineendhere his knell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is heavy , his feet lineendhere beat the floor as i drag him about lineendhere in the swell of the waltz . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with a menacing lineendhere roar , the trumpets crash in lineendhere through the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clangs his lineendhere funeral lineendhere bell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the chaos of lineendhere space rolls the earth to the lineendhere hideous glee of death ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and so cramped lineendhere is this place , i stifle lineendhere and pant . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis he lineendhere throttles lineendhere me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he has covered lineendhere my mouth with lineendhere his face ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and his blood lineendhere has dripped into lineendhere my heart ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and my lineendhere heart beats lineendhere and labours . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his dead limbs have coiled lineendhere every part of my body lineendhere in tentacles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through my ears lineendhere the waltz lineendhere jangles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like glue his lineendhere dead body holds lineendhere me athwart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am lineendhere drowning in lineendhere slime ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and his corpse , like a lineendhere clod , beats me into lineendhere a jelly ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere chime , lineendhere one ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and his dead lineendhere legs keep lineendhere time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fountain bent and lineendhere straightened itself in the night wind , blowing lineendhere like a flower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it gleamed and glittered , a lineendhere tall white lily , under the lineendhere eye of the golden moon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from a stone seat , beneath lineendhere a blossoming lime , the lineendhere man watched it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the spray pattered lineendhere on the dim grass lineendhere at his feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fountain tossed lineendhere its water , up and up , like lineendhere silver marbles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is that lineendhere an arm he lineendhere sees? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and for one moment lineendhere does he catch the moving lineendhere curve of a thigh? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fountain lineendhere gurgled and splashed , and lineendhere the man's face was wet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it singing lineendhere that he lineendhere hears? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a song of lineendhere playing lineendhere at ball? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the moonlight shines on the straight lineendhere column of water , and through it he sees a lineendhere woman , tossing the water -- balls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her breasts point outwards , lineendhere and the nipples are like buds lineendhere of peonies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her flanks ripple as she plays , lineendhere and the water is not more undulating lineendhere than the lines of her body . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere am i not more worth than lineendhere your day ladies , covered with awkward lineendhere stuffs , unreal , unbeautiful? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what do you lineendhere fear in taking lineendhere me? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is not lineendhere the night lineendhere for poets? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am your lineendhere dream , recurrent as water , lineendhere gemmed with the moon ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " she steps to the edge lineendhere of the pool and the water runs , lineendhere rustling , down her sides . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she stretches out her arms , lineendhere and the fountain streams behind her lineendhere like an opened veil . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the morning the lineendhere gardeners came lineendhere to their work . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "there is something lineendhere in the fountain ," said lineendhere one . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they shuddered lineendhere as they laid their dead master lineendhere on the grass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "i will close his eyes ," said the lineendhere head gardener , "it is uncanny to see lineendhere a dead man staring at the sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " i the inkstand is full of ink , and lineendhere the paper lies white and unspotted , in the lineendhere round of light thrown by a candle . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere puffs of darkness sweep into lineendhere the corners , and keep rolling through lineendhere the room behind his chair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the air is silver and lineendhere pearl , for the night is liquid lineendhere with moonlight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see how lineendhere the roof glitters , lineendhere like ice ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over there , a slice of yellow cuts into lineendhere the silver -- blue , and beside it stand two geraniums , purple lineendhere because the light is silver -- blue , to -- night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is coming , the lineendhere young woman with lineendhere the bright hair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she swings a basket as lineendhere she walks , which she places on the sill , between lineendhere the geranium stalks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he laughs , and crumples lineendhere his paper as he leans forward lineendhere to look . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "the basket filled lineendhere with moonlight", what a title lineendhere for a book ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the bellying lineendhere clouds swing over the lineendhere housetops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he has forgotten lineendhere the woman in the room with lineendhere the geraniums . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is beating his lineendhere brain , and in his eardrums hammers lineendhere his heavy pulse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she sits on the lineendhere window -- sill , with the basket lineendhere in her lap . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she lineendhere cracks a lineendhere nut . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shells ricochet upon lineendhere the roof , and get into the gutters , and bounce lineendhere over the edge and disappear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "it is very lineendhere queer ," thinks peter , "the basket lineendhere was empty , i'm sure . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how could lineendhere nuts appear from the lineendhere atmosphere? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the geraniums lineendhere are very gay in their lineendhere crimson array . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the bellying clouds swing over the housetops , lineendhere and over the roofs goes peter to pay his morning's lineendhere work with a holiday . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "annette , lineendhere it is lineendhere i . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " peter lineendhere jumps through the lineendhere window . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "dear , are lineendhere you lineendhere alone? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "look , peter , the lineendhere dome of the tabernacle lineendhere is done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this gold thread is so very high , lineendhere i am glad it is morning , a starry lineendhere sky would have seen me bankrupt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sit down , now tell lineendhere me , is your story lineendhere going well? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the golden dome glittered lineendhere in the orange of the lineendhere setting sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the walls , at intervals , lineendhere hung altar -- cloths and chasubles , and copes , lineendhere and stoles , and coffin palls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all stiff with rich embroidery , and lineendhere stitched with so much artistry , they seemed like spun and woven lineendhere gems , or flower -- buds new -- opened on their stems . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere annette looked at the lineendhere geraniums , very red lineendhere against the blue sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "no matter how i lineendhere try , i cannot find any lineendhere thread of such a red . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my bleeding lineendhere hearts drip stuff muddy lineendhere in comparison . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see my lineendhere little lineendhere pecking dove? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'm in love lineendhere with my own lineendhere temple . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only lineendhere that halo's lineendhere wrong . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the colour's lineendhere too strong , or not strong lineendhere enough . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my eyes lineendhere are lineendhere tired . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , peter , lineendhere don't be so rough; it lineendhere is valuable . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i won't lineendhere do any lineendhere more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you tyrannise , lineendhere dear , that's lineendhere enough . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now sit down lineendhere and amuse me lineendhere while i rest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the shadows of the geraniums lineendhere creep over the floor , and begin to climb lineendhere the opposite wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere peter watches her , fluid with lineendhere fatigue , floating , and drifting , and lineendhere undulant in the orange glow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his senses flow towards lineendhere her , where she lies supine lineendhere and dreaming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere seeming lineendhere drowned in a golden lineendhere halo . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the pungent smell of lineendhere the geraniums lineendhere is hard to bear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he pushes against lineendhere her knees , and brushes his lips lineendhere across her languid hands . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his lips lineendhere are hot lineendhere and speechless . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he woos her , quivering , lineendhere and the room is filled with shadows , lineendhere for the sun has set . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but she only understands the lineendhere ways of a needle through delicate stuffs , and lineendhere the shock of one colour on another . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she does not see that lineendhere this is the same , and querulously lineendhere murmurs his name . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "peter , lineendhere i don't lineendhere want it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and he , the lineendhere undesired , burns lineendhere and is consumed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is a lineendhere crescent moon on the lineendhere rim of the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere iii lineendhere "go home , lineendhere now , peter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to -- night is lineendhere full lineendhere moon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i must lineendhere be lineendhere alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "how soon the lineendhere moon is full lineendhere again ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere annette , lineendhere let me lineendhere stay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere indeed , dear lineendhere love , i shall not lineendhere go away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my god , lineendhere but you keep lineendhere me starved ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you write `no entrance lineendhere here', over all lineendhere the doors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it not strange , my dear , that lineendhere loving , yet you deny me lineendhere entrance everywhere . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere would marriage strike you blind , or , hating lineendhere bonds as you do , why should i be denied the rights lineendhere of loving if i leave you free? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you want the whole of lineendhere me , you pick my brains to rest you , but lineendhere you give me not one heart -- beat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , lineendhere forgive me , lineendhere sweet ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i suffer lineendhere in my loving , lineendhere and you know it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i cannot feed lineendhere my life on being lineendhere a poet .

and squeeze lineendhere the love out . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he answered lineendhere gruffly , "i know lineendhere what i'm about . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "only lineendhere remember lineendhere one thing from to -- night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my work lineendhere is taxing and lineendhere i must have sight ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the clear moon looks lineendhere in between the lineendhere geraniums . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the wall , the shadow of the lineendhere man is divided from the shadow of lineendhere the woman by a silver thread . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are eyes , hundreds lineendhere of eyes , round like lineendhere marbles ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere unwinking , lineendhere for there are no lineendhere lids . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blue , black , gray , and hazel , and lineendhere the irises are cased in the whites , and they lineendhere glitter and spark under the moon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the basket is lineendhere heaped with human lineendhere eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she cracks off lineendhere the whites and throws them lineendhere away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they ricochet upon the lineendhere roof , and get into the gutters , and bounce lineendhere over the edge and disappear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but she is here , lineendhere quietly sitting on the window -- sill , lineendhere eating human eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere iv how lineendhere hot the sheets lineendhere are ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his skin is tormented lineendhere with pricks , and over him sticks , lineendhere and never moves , an eye . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it lights the lineendhere sky with blood , lineendhere and drips blood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the drops sizzle on his bare lineendhere skin , and he smells them burning in , and branding lineendhere his body with the name "annette". lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the blood -- red sky lineendhere is outside his lineendhere window now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and his heart lineendhere wrenches and lineendhere pounds "annette ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the lead of the roof is scorching , lineendhere he ricochets , gets to the edge , bounces lineendhere over and disappears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the bellying lineendhere clouds are red as they swing over lineendhere the housetops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere v the air is of lineendhere silver and pearl , for the night lineendhere is liquid with moonlight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how the ruin lineendhere glistens , like a palace lineendhere of ice ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only two black lineendhere holes swallow the brilliance lineendhere of the moon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere deflowered lineendhere windows , sockets without lineendhere sight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a man lineendhere stands before lineendhere the house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he sees the silver -- blue moonlight , and lineendhere set in it , over his head , staring and flickering , lineendhere eyes of geranium red . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i over lineendhere the yawning chimney lineendhere hangs the fog . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere drip -- hiss -- drip -- hiss -- fall the raindrops lineendhere on the oaken log which burns , and steams , lineendhere and smokes the ceiling beams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere drip -- hiss -- the lineendhere rain never lineendhere stops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wide , state bed lineendhere shivers beneath its lineendhere velvet coverlet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above , dim , in lineendhere the smoke , a tarnished lineendhere coronet gleams dully . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere overhead lineendhere hammers and chinks lineendhere the rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fearfully wails the wind down lineendhere distant corridors , and there comes the swish and lineendhere sigh of rushes lifted off the floors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the arras blows lineendhere sidewise out from the wall , lineendhere and then falls back again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is my lady's lineendhere key , confided with much nice lineendhere cunning , whisperingly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he enters on a sob of lineendhere wind , which gutters the candles lineendhere almost to swaling . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fire lineendhere flutters lineendhere and drops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he shuts lineendhere the lineendhere door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rushes fall lineendhere again to stillness along lineendhere the floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere outside , the lineendhere wind goes lineendhere wailing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the velvet coverlet lineendhere of the wide bed is lineendhere smooth and cold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above , in the lineendhere firelight , winks the lineendhere coronet of tarnished gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the knight shivers in lineendhere his coat of fur , and holds out his hands lineendhere to the withering flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is always lineendhere the same , a sweet lineendhere coquette . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he lineendhere will wait for lineendhere her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how the log lineendhere hisses lineendhere and drips ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how warm and lineendhere satisfying will lineendhere be her lips ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it guilt to free a lady lineendhere from her palsied lord , absent and fighting , lineendhere terribly abhorred? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he stirs a lineendhere booted heel and kicks lineendhere a rolling coal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his spur lineendhere clinks on the lineendhere hearth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere overhead , lineendhere the rain hammers lineendhere and chinks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she lineendhere is so pure lineendhere and whole . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only because he has her soul will lineendhere she resign herself to him , for where the soul has gone , lineendhere the body must be given as a sign . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he takes her by lineendhere the divine right of lineendhere the only lover . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he has sworn lineendhere to fight her lord , and wed lineendhere her after . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere should he be overborne , lineendhere she will die adoring him , forlorn , lineendhere shriven by her great love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above , the lineendhere coronet winks in lineendhere the darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere drip -- hiss -- fall lineendhere the lineendhere raindrops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the arras blows lineendhere out from the wall , and a door bangs lineendhere in a far -- off hall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere candles lineendhere swale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the gale lineendhere the moat below plunges lineendhere and spatters . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere will the lady lineendhere lose courage and not lineendhere come? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rain claps lineendhere on a loosened lineendhere rafter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is lineendhere that lineendhere laughter? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the room lineendhere is filled with lisps and lineendhere whispers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one candle lineendhere drowns and the other lineendhere gutters . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is that the rain which pads lineendhere and patters , is it the wind through the winding lineendhere entries which chatters? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the state bed is very lineendhere cold and he is lineendhere alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how far from lineendhere the wall the arras lineendhere is blown ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is no lineendhere storm which makes these little lineendhere chuckling sounds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by the great wounds of holy lineendhere jesus , it is his dear lady , kissing lineendhere and clasping someone ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through the sobbing storm lineendhere he hears her love take form and lineendhere flutter out in words . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they prick into his ears and stun lineendhere his desire , which lies within him , lineendhere hard and dead , like frozen fire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the lineendhere little noise lineendhere never stops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he tears down the arras lineendhere from before an inner chamber's lineendhere bolted door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ii the state lineendhere bed shivers in the lineendhere watery dawn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for lineendhere the storm never lineendhere stops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the velvet coverlet lineendhere lie two bodies , stripped and fair in lineendhere the cold , grey air . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere drip -- hiss -- fall the blood -- drops , for lineendhere the bleeding never lineendhere stops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at each side of lineendhere the bed , on the lineendhere floor , is a head . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a man's on this side , a woman's lineendhere on that , and the red blood oozes lineendhere along the rush mat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a wisp of paper is lineendhere twisted carefully into the strands lineendhere of the dead man's hair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it says , "my lord: your lineendhere wife's paramour has paid with lineendhere his life for the high favour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " through the lady's lineendhere silver fillet is wound lineendhere another paper . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it reads , "most noble lineendhere lord: your wife's misdeeds are as a double -- stranded lineendhere necklace of beads . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i have engaged lineendhere that , on your return , she lineendhere shall welcome you here . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she will not spurn your lineendhere love as before , you have still lineendhere the best part of her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her blood was red , her lineendhere body white , they will both be lineendhere here for your delight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the soul inside was a lineendhere lump of dirt , i have rid you of that with lineendhere a spurt of my sword point . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere good luck lineendhere to your lineendhere pleasure . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she will be lineendhere quite complaisant , lineendhere my friend , i wager . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the end was lineendhere a splashed flourish lineendhere of ink . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the passage is heard lineendhere the clink of armour , the tread lineendhere of a heavy man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the door bursts open and standing there , lineendhere his thin hair wavering in the glare of steely lineendhere daylight , is my lord of clair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over the lineendhere yawning chimney lineendhere hangs the fog . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere overhead hammers lineendhere and chinks the rain which never lineendhere stops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the velvet coverlet lineendhere is sodden and wet , yet the lineendhere roof beams are tight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere overhead , the lineendhere coronet gleams with its blackened lineendhere gold , winking and blinking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere among the rushes lineendhere three corpses are lineendhere growing cold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere iii in the castle church you may see lineendhere them stand , two sumptuous tombs on either hand of the choir , my lineendhere lord's and my lady's , grand in sculptured filigrees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and where the transepts of the church expand , lineendhere a crusader , come from the holy land , lies with lineendhere crossed legs and embroidered band . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the page's lineendhere name became a brand lineendhere for shame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he was buried in crawling lineendhere sand , after having been burnt by lineendhere royal command . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the bell lineendhere in the convent tower lineendhere swung . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high overhead the lineendhere great sun hung , a navel lineendhere for the curving sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the air lineendhere was a blue lineendhere clarity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere swallows lineendhere flew , and lineendhere a cock crew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the iron clanging lineendhere sank through the light air , rustled lineendhere over with blowing branches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a flare of spotted green , and a lineendhere snake had gone into the bed where the snowdrops shone lineendhere in green new -- started , their white bells parted . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere two by two , in a long lineendhere brown line , the nuns were walking to breathe lineendhere the fine bright april air . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they must go in lineendhere soon and work at their tasks all lineendhere the afternoon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but lineendhere this time lineendhere is theirs ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they walk lineendhere in lineendhere pairs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere first comes the abbess , preoccupied lineendhere and slow , as a woman often tried , with lineendhere her temper in bond . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then the lineendhere oldest lineendhere nun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then younger and younger , lineendhere until the last one has a laugh on lineendhere her lips , and fairly skips . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they wind about the lineendhere gravel walks and all the long lineendhere line buzzes and talks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they step in time lineendhere to the ringing bell , with scarcely lineendhere a shadow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun is well in lineendhere the core of a sky lineendhere domed silverly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sister marguerite lineendhere said: "the pears will lineendhere soon bud . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " sister angelique lineendhere said she must get her spud and free the lineendhere earth round the jasmine roots . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sister lineendhere veronique said: lineendhere "oh , look at those shoots ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there's a lineendhere crocus up , with lineendhere a purple cup . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " but sister clotilde said nothing lineendhere at all , she looked up and down the old grey wall to lineendhere see if a lizard were basking there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she looked across the lineendhere garden to where a sycamore lineendhere flanked the garden door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she was restless , although her little feet lineendhere danced , and quite unsatisfied , for it chanced her morning's work lineendhere had hung in her mind and would not take form . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she could not find the lineendhere beautifulness for lineendhere the virgin's dress . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere should it be lineendhere of pink , or lineendhere damasked blue? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or perhaps lineendhere lilac with gold lineendhere shotted through? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere should it be banded lineendhere with yellow and white roses , lineendhere or sparked like a frosty night? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or a crimson lineendhere sheen over some sort lineendhere of green? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but clotilde's eyes saw nothing new in lineendhere all the garden , no single hue so lovely or so lineendhere marvellous that its use would not seem impious . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so on she lineendhere walked , and the others lineendhere talked . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sister elisabeth edged away from what her lineendhere companion had to say , for sister marthe saw the world in little , she lineendhere weighed every grain and recorded each tittle . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she did plain lineendhere stitching and worked lineendhere in the kitchen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "sister radegonde lineendhere knows the apples won't last , i lineendhere told her so this friday past . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i must speak lineendhere to her before lineendhere compline . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " her words were like lineendhere dust motes in slanting lineendhere sunshine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the other lineendhere nun sighed , with her pleasure lineendhere quite dried . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly sister lineendhere berthe cried out: "the snowdrops lineendhere are blooming ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " they lineendhere turned lineendhere about . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the little white cups bent over the lineendhere ground , and in among the light stems wound a crested lineendhere snake , with his eyes awake . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his crest was amber lineendhere glittered with blue , and opaque lineendhere so the sun came shining through . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it seemed a lineendhere crown with lineendhere fiery points . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when he quivered all down lineendhere his scaly joints , from every lineendhere slot the sparkles shot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the nuns huddled lineendhere tightly together , fear catching lineendhere their senses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but clotilde must peer lineendhere more closely at the beautiful snake , lineendhere she seemed entranced and eased . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere could she make lineendhere colours so rare , lineendhere the dress were there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the abbess lineendhere shook off her lineendhere lethargy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "sisters , lineendhere we will walk lineendhere on ," said she . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sidling away from the lineendhere snowdrop bed , the line curved forwards , lineendhere the abbess ahead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only clotilde lineendhere was the last to lineendhere yield . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the recreation lineendhere hour was done each went lineendhere in to her task . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alone in the library , with lineendhere its great north light , clotilde wrought at an exquisite lineendhere wreath of flowers for her book of hours . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they framed the lineendhere picture she had lineendhere made , half -- delighted and half -- afraid . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in a courtyard with a lozenged lineendhere floor the virgin watched , and through the arched door the angel lineendhere came like a springing flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his wings were dipped in violet lineendhere fire , his limbs were strung to lineendhere holy desire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he lowered his head and lineendhere passed under the arch , and the air lineendhere seemed beating a solemn march . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the virgin waited lineendhere with eyes lineendhere dilated . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her face was quiet lineendhere and innocent , and beautiful lineendhere with her strange assent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a silver thread lineendhere about her head her halo lineendhere was poised . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but in the stead of lineendhere her gown , there remained the lineendhere vellum , unstained . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clotilde painted the flowers lineendhere patiently , lingering over lineendhere each tint and dye . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she could spend great pains , lineendhere now she had seen that curious , lineendhere unimagined green . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a colour lineendhere so strange it had seemed lineendhere to change . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she thought it lineendhere had altered while lineendhere she gazed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at first it had been simple green; then glazed all lineendhere over with twisting flames , each spot a molten colour , trembling lineendhere and hot , and every eye seemed to liquefy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she had made lineendhere a plan , and her lineendhere spirits danced . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere after all , she had only glanced at that lineendhere wonderful snake , and she must know just what hues made the creature lineendhere throw those splashes and sprays of prismed rays . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when evening prayers lineendhere were sung and said , the nuns lit lineendhere their tapers and went to bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and soon in the convent there was no lineendhere light , for the moon did not rise until late that night , lineendhere only the shine of the lamp at the shrine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clotilde lay lineendhere still in her trembling lineendhere sheets . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her heart lineendhere shook her body lineendhere with its beats . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she could not see till the moon should lineendhere rise , so she whispered prayers and kept her eyes lineendhere on the window -- square till light should be there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the faintest shadow lineendhere of a branch fell lineendhere on the floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clotilde , grown staunch with solemn lineendhere purpose , softly rose and fluttered down between lineendhere the rows of sleeping nuns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she lineendhere almost lineendhere runs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she must go out through the little lineendhere side door lest the nuns who were always praying before lineendhere the virgin's altar should hear her pass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she pushed the bolts , and lineendhere over the grass the red moon's lineendhere brim mounted its rim . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her shadow crept up the convent wall as lineendhere she swiftly left it , over all the garden lay the level glow of lineendhere a moon coming up , very big and slow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere gravel lineendhere glistened . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she stopped lineendhere and lineendhere listened . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was still , and lineendhere the moonlight was lineendhere getting clearer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she laughed a little , lineendhere but she felt queerer than ever lineendhere before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the snowdrop bed lineendhere was reached and she bent lineendhere down her head . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the striped lineendhere ground the snake lineendhere was wound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for a moment clotilde lineendhere paused in alarm , then she rolled up lineendhere her sleeve and stretched out her arm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she thought she lineendhere heard steps , she must lineendhere be quick . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she darted her hand lineendhere out , and seized the thick wriggling lineendhere slime , only just in time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old gardener came muttering lineendhere down the path , and his shadow fell like a broad , black swath , lineendhere and covered clotilde and the angry snake . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he bit her , lineendhere but what difference lineendhere did that make ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the virgin lineendhere should dress in his lineendhere loveliness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gardener was covering lineendhere his new -- set plants for the night was chilly , and nothing daunts lineendhere your lover of growing things . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he spied something to do lineendhere and turned aside , and the moonlight lineendhere streamed on clotilde , and gleamed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his business lineendhere finished the gardener lineendhere rose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he shook and swore , for the moonlight shows lineendhere a girl with a fire -- tongued serpent , she grasping him , lineendhere laughing , while quietly her eyes are weeping . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is lineendhere he lineendhere sleeping? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he thinks it is some holy vision , brushes that aside lineendhere and with decision jumps -- and hits the snake with his stick , crushes his spine , lineendhere and then with quick , urgent command takes her hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gardener sucks the poison lineendhere and spits , cursing and praying as befits a poor lineendhere old man half out of his wits . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "whatever possessed you , sister , lineendhere it's hatched of a devil and lineendhere very evil . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it's one of them lineendhere horrid basilisks lineendhere you read about . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they say a man risks lineendhere his life to touch it , but i guess i've lineendhere sucked it out by now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lucky i lineendhere chucked it away lineendhere from you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is dead now , but his lineendhere colours won't fade at once , and by noon i lineendhere shall have made the virgin's robe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , francois , see lineendhere how kindly the moon shines lineendhere down on me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i can't die lineendhere yet , for the lineendhere task was set . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "you won't die now , for i've lineendhere sucked it away ," grumbled old lineendhere francois , "so have your play . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if the virgin is set on lineendhere snake's colours so strong , -- " "francois , don't say lineendhere things like that , it is wrong . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " so clotilde lineendhere vented lineendhere her creed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "he can't do lineendhere no more harm , sister ," lineendhere said he . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "paint as lineendhere much as lineendhere you like . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and gingerly lineendhere he picked up the snake lineendhere with his stick . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clotilde thanked him , and begged that lineendhere he would shield her secret , though itching lineendhere to talk in the kitchen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at dawn's first lineendhere saffron -- spired warning clotilde lineendhere was up . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and all that morning , except when she went lineendhere to the chapel to pray , she painted , and when the april lineendhere day was hot with sun , clotilde had done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she drooped , though her heart beat loud at lineendhere the beauty before her , and her spirit bowed to the lineendhere virgin her finely -- touched thought had made . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a lady , lineendhere in excellence arrayed , lineendhere and wonder -- souled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from long fasting clotilde felt weary lineendhere and faint , but her eyes were starred like those of a saint enmeshed lineendhere in heaven's beatitude . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a sudden clamour lineendhere hurled its rude force to break lineendhere her vision awake . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the door nearly leapt lineendhere from its hinges , pushed by the lineendhere multitude of nuns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they hushed when they saw clotilde , lineendhere in perfect quiet , smiling , a little lineendhere perplexed at the riot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and all lineendhere the hive buzzed lineendhere "she's alive ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he had found the strain of lineendhere silence too great , and preferred the pain lineendhere of a conscience outraged . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the news had spread , lineendhere and all were convinced clotilde lineendhere must be dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for francois , to lineendhere spite them , had not seen lineendhere fit to right them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how could we have lineendhere guessed our convent lineendhere so blessed ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to lineendhere have lineendhere you die ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i , who am lineendhere a hollow , living shell , the lineendhere grave is empty of me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere holy mary , i lineendhere crave to be taken , dear mother , instead lineendhere of this other . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " she dropped on her knees and lineendhere silently prayed , with anguished hands and lineendhere tears delayed to a painful slowness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the minutes lineendhere drew to lineendhere fractions . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then the west wind lineendhere blew the sound of a bell , on lineendhere a gusty swell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it came skipping over the slates of lineendhere the roof , and the bright bell -- notes seemed a reproof to lineendhere grief , in the eye of so fair a day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the abbess , lineendhere comforted , ceased lineendhere to pray . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the sun lit lineendhere the flowers in clotilde's lineendhere book of hours . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it glistened the green of the virgin's dress and lineendhere made the red spots , in a flushed excess , pulse and start; and the violet lineendhere wings of the angel were colour which shines and sings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the book seemed lineendhere a choir of rainbow lineendhere fire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the abbess crossed herself , and each nun did lineendhere the same , then one by one , they filed to the chapel , that incensed prayers lineendhere might plead for the life of this sister of theirs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clotilde , lineendhere the lineendhere inspired ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she only lineendhere felt lineendhere tired . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old chronicles say lineendhere she did not die until lineendhere heavy with years . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and that is why there hangs in the convent lineendhere church a basket of osiered silver , a holy casket , lineendhere and treasured therein a dried snake -- skin . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere panels of claret lineendhere and blue which shine under the lineendhere moon like lees of wine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a coronet done in a golden lineendhere scroll , and wheels which blunder and creak as they roll through lineendhere the muddy ruts of a moorland track . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they lineendhere daren't lineendhere look back ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are whipping lineendhere and cursing the lineendhere horses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what brutes lineendhere men are when lineendhere they think they're scored . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are scared lineendhere half out of their wits , lineendhere poor souls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for my lord has a casket lineendhere full of rolls of minted sovereigns , lineendhere and silver bars . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i laugh to lineendhere think how he'll show his scars lineendhere in london to -- morrow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he whines with lineendhere rage in his varnished lineendhere cage . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my lady lineendhere has shoved her rings over lineendhere her toes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis an ancient lineendhere trick every night -- rider lineendhere knows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i shall relieve her of them yet , when lineendhere i see she limps in the minuet i must beg to lineendhere celebrate this night , and the green moonlight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there's nothing to hurry lineendhere about , the plain is hours lineendhere long , and the mud's a strain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my gelding's uncommonly lineendhere strong in the loins , in half an lineendhere hour i'll bag the coins . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis a clear , lineendhere sweet night on the lineendhere turn of spring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere chase is lineendhere the thing ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how the coach flashes lineendhere and wobbles , the moon dripping lineendhere down so quietly on it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a tune is beating out lineendhere of the curses and screams , and the cracking lineendhere all through the painted seams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere steady , old lineendhere horse , we'll keep lineendhere it in sight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis lineendhere a rare fine lineendhere night ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there's a clump of trees on lineendhere the dip of the down , and the sky shimmers lineendhere where it hangs over the town . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it seems a shame to break the air lineendhere in two with this pistol , but i've my share lineendhere of drudgery like other men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hold up , lineendhere you beast , now lineendhere what the devil ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere confound this lineendhere moor for a pockholed , evil , lineendhere rotten marsh . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my lineendhere right lineendhere leg's snapped . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis a mercy lineendhere he's rolled , but i'm nicely lineendhere capped . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a broken -- legged lineendhere man and a lineendhere broken -- legged horse ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they'll lineendhere get me , of lineendhere course . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cursed coach will reach the town and lineendhere they'll all come out , every loafer grown a lineendhere lion to handcuff a man that's down . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , the lineendhere coachman's bulleted lineendhere hat ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll give lineendhere it a head lineendhere to fit it pat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _they handcuffed the body just lineendhere for style , and they hung him in chains for the lineendhere volatile wind to scour him flesh from bones . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere way out on the moor you lineendhere can hear the groans his gibbet makes lineendhere when it blows a gale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'tis a lineendhere common lineendhere tale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _ paul jannes was working very late , for lineendhere this watch must be done by eight to -- morrow or the lineendhere cardinal would certainly be vexed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so they picked his pocket , lineendhere and he paid in jewels for his lineendhere slobbering kisses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this watch was made to buy him blisses lineendhere from an austrian countess on her way home , lineendhere and she meant to start next day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul worked by the pointed , tulip -- flame of a tallow lineendhere candle , and became so absorbed , that his old clock made him lineendhere wince striking the hour a moment since . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere its echo , only lineendhere half apprehended , lingered lineendhere about the room . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he ended screwing the little rubies in , lineendhere setting the wheels to lock and spin , curling the infinitesimal lineendhere springs , fixing the filigree hands . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere chippings of lineendhere precious stones lay lineendhere strewn about . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the table before lineendhere him was a rout of splashes lineendhere and sparks of coloured light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there was yellow gold lineendhere in sheets , and quite a heap of lineendhere emeralds , and steel . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here was lineendhere a gem , there was lineendhere a wheel . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and glasses lay like limpid lakes shining and lineendhere still , and there were flakes of silver , and shavings of pearl , and little lineendhere wires all awhirl with the light of the candle . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he took the watch and wound its hands lineendhere about to match the time , then glanced up to lineendhere take the hour from the hanging clock . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere good , lineendhere merciful lineendhere power ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how came that shadow lineendhere on the wall , no woman lineendhere was in the room ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his tall chiffonier lineendhere stood gaunt behind lineendhere his chair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his old lineendhere cloak , rabbit -- lined , lineendhere hung from a peg . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere door was lineendhere closed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere just for a lineendhere moment he must lineendhere have dozed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he looked again , lineendhere and saw it lineendhere plain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the silhouette made a blue -- black stain on lineendhere the opposite wall , and it never wavered even when the lineendhere candle quavered under his panting breath . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what made that beautiful , dreadful thing , that lineendhere shade of something so lovely , so exquisite , cast from a substance which lineendhere the sight had not been tutored to perceive? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul brushed lineendhere his eyes across lineendhere his sleeve . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clear -- cut , the shadow on lineendhere the wall gleamed black , and never lineendhere moved at all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul's watches were like amulets , wrought into lineendhere patterns and rosettes; the cases were all set with stones , lineendhere and wreathing lines , and shining zones . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he knew the beauty in a curve , and lineendhere the shadow tortured every nerve with its perfect lineendhere rhythm of outline cutting the whitewashed wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so fine was the neck he lineendhere knew he could have spanned it about with lineendhere the fingers of one hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lady lineendhere was edged with the lineendhere stamp of race . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a lineendhere singular vision lineendhere in such a place . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he moved the candle to lineendhere the tall chiffonier; the lineendhere shadow stayed on the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he threw his cloak upon lineendhere a chair , and still the lady's lineendhere face was there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from every corner lineendhere of the room he saw , in the patch of lineendhere light , the gloom that was the lady . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her violet bloom lineendhere was almost brighter than that lineendhere which came from his candle's tulip -- flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he set the filigree hands; he laid lineendhere the watch in the case which he had made; he put on his lineendhere rabbit cloak , and snuffed his candle out . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the room seemed lineendhere stuffed with lineendhere darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere softly he crossed lineendhere the floor , and let himself lineendhere out through the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun was flashing lineendhere from every pin and wheel , lineendhere when paul let himself in . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the whitewashed lineendhere walls were hot lineendhere with light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the room was the core of a lineendhere chrysolite , burning and shimmering lineendhere with fiery might . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun was so bright that lineendhere no shadow could fall from the furniture lineendhere upon the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul sighed as he looked at lineendhere the empty space where a glare lineendhere usurped the lady's place . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he settled himself to his work , but his mind wandered , lineendhere and he would wake to find his hand suspended , his eyes grown dim , and lineendhere nothing advanced beyond the rim of his dreaming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cardinal sent to lineendhere pay for his watch , which had purchased lineendhere so fine a day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but paul could hardly lineendhere touch the gold , it seemed the price lineendhere of his shadow , sold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with the first twilight he struck a lineendhere match and watched the little blue stars hatch into lineendhere an egg of perfect flame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he lit his candle , lineendhere and almost in shame at his lineendhere eagerness , lifted his eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shadow was there , lineendhere and its precise outline etched lineendhere the cold , white wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the young lineendhere man swore , "by lineendhere god ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you , paul , there's lineendhere something the matter lineendhere with your brain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere go home now lineendhere and sleep off lineendhere the strain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the next day was lineendhere a storm , the rain whispered lineendhere and scratched at the window -- pane . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a grey and lineendhere shadowless morning filled lineendhere the little shop . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the watches , lineendhere chilled , were dead and sparkless lineendhere as burnt -- out coals . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gems lay on the table lineendhere like shoals of stranded shells , their colours faded , mere heaps lineendhere of stone , dull and degraded . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul's head was heavy , lineendhere his hands obeyed no orders , lineendhere for his fancy strayed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his work became a lineendhere simple round of watches repaired lineendhere and watches wound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the slanting ribbons of the lineendhere rain broke themselves on the window -- pane , but paul lineendhere saw the silver lines in vain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the morning lineendhere he selected all his lineendhere perfect jacinths . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when , at dusk , the lineendhere shadow grew upon the lineendhere wall , paul's work was through . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere holding the watch , he spoke to lineendhere her: "lady , beautiful shadow , stir lineendhere into one brief sign of being . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere turn your eyes this way , and seeing this watch , made from lineendhere those sweet curves where your hair from your forehead swerves , accept the gift lineendhere which i have wrought with your fairness in my thought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grant me this , and lineendhere i shall be honoured lineendhere overwhelmingly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the shadow rested lineendhere black and still , and the wind sighed lineendhere over the window -- sill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere topazes ran in a foamy lineendhere stream over the cover , the hands were studded with lineendhere garnets , and seemed red roses , budded . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the face was of crystal , and engraved lineendhere upon it the figures flashed and waved with zircons , lineendhere and beryls , and amethysts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it took a week to make , lineendhere and his trysts at night with the lineendhere shadow were his alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul swore lineendhere not to speak till his lineendhere task was done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the night that lineendhere the jewel was lineendhere worthy to give . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul watched the long hours of daylight live to the lineendhere faintest streak; then lit his light , and sharp against the wall's pure white lineendhere the outline of the shadow started into form . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his burning -- hearted words lineendhere so long imprisoned swelled to lineendhere tumbling speech . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like one compelled , he told the lady all lineendhere his love , and holding out the watch above his head , he lineendhere knelt , imploring some littlest sign . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere shadow lineendhere was dumb . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere weeks passed , paul worked in fevered lineendhere haste , and everything he made he lineendhere placed before his lady . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shadow lineendhere kept its perfect lineendhere passiveness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he wooed her with the work lineendhere of his hands , he waited for those dear lineendhere commands she never gave . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no word , no motion , lineendhere eased the ache of his lineendhere devotion . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his days passed in a lineendhere strain of toil , his nights burnt up lineendhere in a seething coil . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere seasons shot by , lineendhere uncognisant lineendhere he worked . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shadow lineendhere came to haunt even lineendhere his days . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sometimes quite plain he lineendhere saw on the wall the blackberry stain of lineendhere his lady's picture . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no sun was bright lineendhere enough to dazzle that lineendhere from his sight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then he lineendhere would curse himself lineendhere and her ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and more , the beauty lineendhere he could not make , and give her , lineendhere for her comfort's sake ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he would beat his weary , empty hands upon lineendhere the table , would hold up strands of silver and gold , and ask her lineendhere why she scorned the best which he could buy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he would pray as to lineendhere some high -- niched saint , that she would cure him of lineendhere the taint of failure . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he would clutch the wall with his bleeding lineendhere fingers , if she should fall he could catch , and lineendhere hold her , and make her live ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with sobs he would lineendhere ask her to forgive all lineendhere he had done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and broken , spent , he would call himself lineendhere impertinent; presumptuous; a tradesman; a nothing; lineendhere driven to madness by the sight of heaven . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there were days when he wooed as a lover , lineendhere sighed in tenderness , spoke to his bride , urged her to lineendhere patience , said his skill should break the spell . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a man's sworn will lineendhere could compass life , even lineendhere that , he knew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he lineendhere would prove lineendhere it true ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the edge of lineendhere the shadow never lineendhere blurred . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lips of the lineendhere shadow never lineendhere stirred . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he would climb on chairs lineendhere to reach her lips , and pat her lineendhere hair with his finger -- tips . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then , deadly sick , he would lie in a swoon lineendhere for hours , while thick phantasmagoria crowded his lineendhere brain , and his body shrieked in the clutch of pain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the crisis passed , he would wake and smile with a vacant lineendhere joy , half -- imbecile and quite confused , not being certain why he was suffering; a curtain lineendhere fallen over the tortured mind beguiled his sorrow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere like a little child he would play with his watches lineendhere and gems , with glee calling the shadow to look and see how the spots lineendhere on the ceiling danced prettily when he flashed his stones . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "mother , the green has lineendhere slid so cunningly in between lineendhere the blue and the yellow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , lineendhere please look lineendhere down ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one morning he threw the street door lineendhere wide on coming in , and his vigorous stride made the lineendhere tools on his table rattle and jump . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in his hands he carried a lineendhere new -- burst clump of laurel blossoms , whose smooth -- barked lineendhere stalks were pliant with sap . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as a husband talks to lineendhere the wife he left an hour ago , lineendhere paul spoke to the shadow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "dear , you know to -- day the calendar calls lineendhere it spring , and i woke this morning gathering lineendhere asphodels , in my dreams , for you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so i rushed out to see what flowers blew their pink -- and -- purple -- scented lineendhere souls across the town -- wind's dusty scrolls , and made the approach to the market lineendhere square a garden with smells and sunny air . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i feel so well and lineendhere happy to -- day , i think i shall lineendhere take a holiday . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and to -- night lineendhere we will have a lineendhere little treat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am going lineendhere to bring you something lineendhere to eat ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " he looked at lineendhere the shadow lineendhere anxiously . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was lineendhere quite grave and lineendhere silent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he shut the outer lineendhere door and came and leant lineendhere against the window -- frame . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "dearest ," he said , "we lineendhere live apart although i lineendhere bear you in my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we look lineendhere out each from a different lineendhere world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at any moment lineendhere we may be hurled lineendhere asunder . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they follow their lineendhere orbits , we obey their laws lineendhere entirely . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now you must come , or i go there , lineendhere unless we are willing to live the flare of lineendhere a lighted instant and have it gone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " a bee in lineendhere the laurels began lineendhere to drone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a loosened lineendhere petal fluttered lineendhere prone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "man grows by eating , if you eat lineendhere you will be filled with our life , sweet lineendhere will be our planet in your mouth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if not , i must parch in death's wide lineendhere drouth until i gain to where you are , and give you myself lineendhere in whatever star may happen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it lineendhere not ordered lineendhere cleverly? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the shadow , bloomed lineendhere like a plum , and clear , lineendhere hung in the sunlight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it lineendhere did lineendhere not hear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul slipped away lineendhere as the dusk began to lineendhere dim the little shop . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he ran to the nearest lineendhere inn , and chose with care as much lineendhere as his thin purse could bear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere returning , he brushed his lineendhere tools aside , and laid across the table lineendhere a wide napkin . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he put a glass and lineendhere plate on either side , lineendhere in duplicate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over the lady's , lineendhere excellent with loveliness , lineendhere the laurels bent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the centre the lineendhere white -- flaked pastry stood , and beside lineendhere it the wine flask . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere red as blood was the wine lineendhere which should bring the lustihood of human lineendhere life to his lady's veins . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he put meat on her lineendhere plate and filled her glass , and waited lineendhere what should come to pass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shadow lineendhere lay quietly on lineendhere the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from the street outside lineendhere came a watchman's call "a lineendhere cloudy night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rain lineendhere beginning lineendhere to fall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and still lineendhere he lineendhere waited . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the clock's lineendhere slow tick knocked on the lineendhere silence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he filled his own glass lineendhere full of wine; from his pocket lineendhere he took a paper . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the twine was knotted , lineendhere and he searched a knife from lineendhere his jumbled tools . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cord of lineendhere life snapped as he cut lineendhere the little string . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he knew lineendhere that he must do the lineendhere thing he feared . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he shook powder into the wine , lineendhere and holding it up so the candle's shine sparked a lineendhere ruby through its heart , he drank it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "dear , never lineendhere apart lineendhere again ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you have said lineendhere it was mine lineendhere to do . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is done , and lineendhere i am come lineendhere to you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " paul jannes let lineendhere the empty wine -- glass fall , lineendhere and held out his arms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the insentient wall stared lineendhere down at him with its cold , lineendhere white glare unstained ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shadow lineendhere was not lineendhere there ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere paul clutched lineendhere and tore at his tightening lineendhere throat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he felt the veins in his body bloat , lineendhere and the hot blood run like fire and stones along lineendhere the sides of his cracking bones . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but he laughed as he staggered lineendhere towards the door , and he laughed aloud lineendhere as he sank on the floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the coroner took the lineendhere body away , and the watches were lineendhere sold that saturday . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the auctioneer said lineendhere one could seldom buy such watches , lineendhere and the prices were high . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere holy mother lineendhere of god , merciful lineendhere mary . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am lineendhere very lineendhere weary . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have come from a village lineendhere miles away , all day i have been coming , lineendhere and i ache for such far roaming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i cannot walk as lineendhere light as i used , and my lineendhere thoughts grow confused . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am lineendhere heavier lineendhere than i was . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mary lineendhere mother , you lineendhere know the cause ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beautiful holy lineendhere lady , take my shame lineendhere away from me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let this fear be only lineendhere seeming , let it be that i lineendhere am dreaming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for months i have lineendhere hoped it was so , now i am lineendhere afraid i know . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lady , why should this lineendhere be shame , just because i lineendhere haven't got his name . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he loved me , yes , lineendhere lady , he did , and he couldn't lineendhere keep it hid . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we lineendhere meant to lineendhere marry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why did lineendhere he lineendhere die? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that day when they told me he had gone lineendhere down in the avalanche , and could not be found until lineendhere the snow melted in spring , i did nothing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere could lineendhere not cry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why lineendhere should lineendhere he die? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why should he lineendhere die and his lineendhere child live? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his little child lineendhere alive in me , for lineendhere my comfort . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no , good lineendhere god , for my lineendhere misery ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i cannot face the shame , to be lineendhere a mother , and not married , and the poor child to lineendhere be reviled for having no father . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere merciful mother , lineendhere holy virgin , take away lineendhere this sin i did . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let the lineendhere baby lineendhere not be . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only take lineendhere the stigma lineendhere off of me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have told lineendhere no one but you , holy lineendhere mary . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my mother would call me "whore", and spit lineendhere upon me; the priest would have me repent , and have lineendhere the rest of my life spent in a convent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am no whore , no lineendhere bad woman , he loved me , and lineendhere we were to be married . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i carried him always in lineendhere my heart , what did it matter if i lineendhere gave him the least part of me too? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you were a virgin , holy lineendhere mother , but you had a son , you know there lineendhere are times when a woman must give all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is some lineendhere call to give and lineendhere hold back nothing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i swear i obeyed lineendhere god then , and this child who lives lineendhere in me is the sign . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is dead , lineendhere my beautiful , lineendhere strong man ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall never lineendhere feel him caress lineendhere me again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this is lineendhere the only baby lineendhere i shall have . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , holy lineendhere virgin , protect lineendhere my baby ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my little , lineendhere helpless lineendhere baby ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he will look like his father , lineendhere and he will be as fast a runner lineendhere and as good a shot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not that he lineendhere shall be no scholar lineendhere neither . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how can i lineendhere think such things , i lineendhere am not good . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my father will have nothing lineendhere to do with my boy , i shall be lineendhere an outcast thing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , mother of our lineendhere lord god , be merciful , take lineendhere away my shame ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let my body lineendhere be as it was before lineendhere he came . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no little baby for lineendhere me to keep underneath my lineendhere heart for those long months . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to live lineendhere for and to get comfort lineendhere from . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i cannot lineendhere go home and tell my lineendhere mother . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is lineendhere so hard and lineendhere righteous . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she never loved my lineendhere father , and we were born for lineendhere duty , not for love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere cannot lineendhere face it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere holy mother , lineendhere take my baby lineendhere away ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere take away lineendhere my little lineendhere baby ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i don't lineendhere want it , i lineendhere can't bear it ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i lineendhere shall have nothing , lineendhere nothing ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere just be lineendhere known as a lineendhere good girl . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere have other men want to lineendhere marry me , whom i could not touch , lineendhere after having known my man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is gone , my man , i shall lineendhere never hear him or feel him again , lineendhere but i could not touch another . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i would rather lineendhere lie under the snow with my lineendhere own man in my arms ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so i shall lineendhere live on lineendhere and on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere just a lineendhere good lineendhere woman . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with nothing to warm my lineendhere heart where he lay , and where he left his lineendhere baby for me to care for . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall not lineendhere be quite human , lineendhere i think . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere merely lineendhere a stone -- dead lineendhere creature . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they will lineendhere respect lineendhere me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what do lineendhere i care lineendhere for respect ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you didn't care for lineendhere people's tongues when you were lineendhere carrying our lord jesus . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god had my man give me lineendhere my baby , when he knew that he was going lineendhere to take him away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his lips will comfort lineendhere me , his hands will lineendhere soothe me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all day i will work at my lace -- making , and lineendhere all night i will keep him warm by my side and pray the blessed lineendhere angels to cover him with their wings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dear mother , lineendhere what is it that lineendhere sings? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hear voices lineendhere singing , and lovely silver lineendhere trumpets through it all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they seem just lineendhere on the other lineendhere side of the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let me lineendhere keep my baby , holy lineendhere mother . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is only a poor lace -- maker's lineendhere baby , with a stain upon him , but give me strength lineendhere to bring him up to be a man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tang of fruitage in the air; red lineendhere boughs bursting everywhere; shimmering of seeded lineendhere grass; hooded gentians all a'mass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere warmth of earth , and cloudless wind tearing lineendhere off the husky rind , blowing feathered seeds to lineendhere fall by the sun -- baked , sheltering wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beech trees in a golden lineendhere haze; hardy sumachs all ablaze , glowing lineendhere through the silver birches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how that lineendhere pine tree shouts lineendhere and lurches ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from the sunny lineendhere door -- jamb high , swings the shell lineendhere of a butterfly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere scrape of insect lineendhere violins through the stubble lineendhere shrilly dins . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere every blade's a minaret where lineendhere a small muezzin's set , loudly calling us lineendhere to pray at the miracle of day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then the purple -- lidded night westering lineendhere comes , her footsteps light guided by the radiant lineendhere boon of a sickle -- shaped new moon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the brown water , thick and silver -- sheened lineendhere in the sunshine , liquid and cool in the lineendhere shade of the reeds , a pike dozed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lost among the lineendhere shadows of stems he lineendhere lay unnoticed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly he flicked his lineendhere tail , and a green -- and -- copper brightness ran lineendhere under the water . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere out from under the reeds lineendhere came the olive -- green light , and orange lineendhere flashed up through the sun -- thickened water . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so the fish passed across the pool , green and copper , lineendhere a darkness and a gleam , and the blurred reflections of the willows lineendhere on the opposite bank received it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where is lineendhere she , the woman lineendhere who wore it? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the scent of lineendhere her lingers lineendhere and drugs me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a languor , fire -- shotted , runs through me , and i crush lineendhere the scarf down on my face , and gulp in the warmth and the lineendhere blueness , and my eyes swim in cool -- tinted heavens . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere around me are lineendhere columns of marble , and lineendhere a diapered , sun -- flickered pavement . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rose -- leaves blow lineendhere and patter against lineendhere it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere below the lineendhere stone steps a lute lineendhere tinkles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a jar of green lineendhere jade throws its shadow lineendhere half over the floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a big -- bellied frog hops through the sunlight lineendhere and plops in the gold -- bubbled water of a basin , sunk lineendhere in the black and white marble . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the west wind has lifted a scarf on lineendhere the seat close beside me , the blue of it is lineendhere a violent outrage of colour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she draws it more closely lineendhere about her , and it ripples beneath lineendhere her slight stirring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how loud clocks can tick lineendhere when a room is empty , lineendhere and one is alone ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my daffodil -- crowned , lineendhere slim and without lineendhere sandals ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as the sudden spurt of flame upon darkness lineendhere so my eyeballs are startled with you , supple -- limbed youth among lineendhere the fruit -- trees , light runner through tasselled orchards . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you are an almond flower lineendhere unsheathed leaping and flickering between lineendhere the budded branches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as i would free the white almond lineendhere from the green husk so would i strip your lineendhere trappings off , beloved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and fingering the smooth and lineendhere polished kernel i should see that in my hands lineendhere glittered a gem beyond counting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the neighbour sits lineendhere in his window and lineendhere plays the flute . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from my bed i can hear him , and the round lineendhere notes flutter and tap about the room , and hit against each lineendhere other , blurring to unexpected chords . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is very beautiful , lineendhere with the little flute -- notes all about me , lineendhere in the darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the daytime , the neighbour lineendhere eats bread and onions with one hand and lineendhere copies music with the other . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he is fat and has a bald lineendhere head , so i do not look at him , but lineendhere run quickly past his window . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is always lineendhere the sky to look at , or the lineendhere water in the well ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but when night comes and he plays his flute , i lineendhere think of him as a young man , with gold seals hanging from his lineendhere watch , and a blue coat with silver buttons . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you are beautiful and faded like lineendhere an old opera tune played upon a harpsichord; or lineendhere like the sun -- flooded silks of an eighteenth -- century boudoir . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in your eyes smoulder the fallen roses lineendhere of out -- lived minutes , and the perfume of your soul is vague and lineendhere suffusing , with the pungence of sealed spice -- jars . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your half -- tones delight me , lineendhere and i grow mad with gazing lineendhere at your blent colours . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my vigour is lineendhere a new -- minted penny , which lineendhere i cast at your feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gather it up lineendhere from the dust , that its sparkle lineendhere may amuse you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone , lineendhere where trickle and plash the fountains , marble fountains , lineendhere yellowed with much water . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere splashing down moss -- tarnished steps lineendhere it falls , the water; and the air lineendhere is throbbing with it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with its lineendhere gurgling lineendhere and running . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with its lineendhere leaping , and lineendhere deep , cool murmur . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i lineendhere wished for night lineendhere and you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wanted to see lineendhere you in the swimming -- pool , white and shining in lineendhere the silver -- flecked water . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while the moon rode over the garden , lineendhere high in the arch of night , and the scent of the lineendhere lilacs was heavy with stillness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere night , and the lineendhere water , and you in your lineendhere whiteness , bathing ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere guarded within the old red wall's lineendhere embrace , marshalled like soldiers in gay company , lineendhere the tulips stand arrayed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here infantry lineendhere wheels out into lineendhere the sunlight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what bold grace sets lineendhere off their tunics , white with lineendhere crimson lace ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here are platoons of gold -- frocked cavalry , lineendhere with scarlet sabres tossing in the eye of purple lineendhere batteries , every gun in place . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere forward they come , with flaunting lineendhere colours spread , with torches burning , stepping out lineendhere in time to some quick , unheard march . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our ears lineendhere are dead , we cannot lineendhere catch the tune . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in pantomime lineendhere parades that lineendhere army . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with our utmost lineendhere powers we hear the wind stream lineendhere through a bed of flowers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as a monk lineendhere who prays" changed to: lineendhere "there are none , ever . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as a monk who prays" lineendhere a tale of starvation: "and lineendhere he neither eat nor drank . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " changed to: "and lineendhere he neither lineendhere ate nor drank . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the great adventure of lineendhere max breuck: stanza headings were originally lineendhere roman numerals . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere terror -- wingéd lineendhere steps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere before the altar , bowed , he stands with lineendhere empty hands; upon it perfumed offerings burn lineendhere wreathing with smoke the sacrificial urn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his sole lineendhere condition love lineendhere and poverty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "shining and distant lineendhere goddess , hear my prayer where lineendhere you swim in the high air ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with charity look down on me , lineendhere under this tree , tending the gifts i have not brought , lineendhere the rare and goodly things i have not sought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere instead , lineendhere take from me all lineendhere my life ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "upon the wings of lineendhere shimmering moonbeams i pack lineendhere my poet's dreams for you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my wearying strife , lineendhere my courage , my loss , into the lineendhere night i toss for you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere golden divinity , deign to look down on me who lineendhere so unworthily offers to you: all life has known , seeds withered unsown , lineendhere hopes turning quick to fears , laughter which dies in tears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shredded remnant of a lineendhere man is all the span and compass lineendhere of my offering to you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "empty and silent , lineendhere i kneel before your pure , calm lineendhere majesty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on this stone , in this urn i pour my heart lineendhere and watch it burn , myself the sacrifice; but lineendhere be still unmoved: divinity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " from the altar , bathed lineendhere in moonlight , the smoke rose straight lineendhere in the quiet night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wild little bird , who chose lineendhere thee for a sign to put upon lineendhere the cover of this book? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who heard thee singing in the distance dim , the vague , lineendhere far greenness of the enshrouding wood , when the damp freshness of the morning lineendhere earth was full of pungent sweetness and thy song? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we do not lineendhere know what bird lineendhere thou art . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere perhaps that fairy bird , fabled in island tale , lineendhere who never sings but once , and then his song is of such fearful beauty lineendhere that he dies from sheer exuberance of melody . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for this they took thee , little bird , lineendhere for this they captured thee , tilting among the leaves , lineendhere and stamped thee for a symbol on this book . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for it contains a lineendhere song surpassing thine , richer , lineendhere more sweet , more poignant . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere glinting golden lineendhere through the trees , apples of lineendhere hesperides ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through the moon -- pierced warp of night shoot pale shafts lineendhere of yellow light , swaying to the kissing breeze swings the lineendhere treasure , golden -- gleaming , apples of hesperides ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere far and lofty yet lineendhere they glimmer , apples lineendhere of hesperides ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blinded by their radiant shimmer , pushing forward lineendhere just for these; dew -- besprinkled , bramble -- marred , poor duped mortal , travel -- scarred , always thinking soon to lineendhere seize and possess the golden -- glistening apples of hesperides ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere orbed , and glittering , lineendhere and pendent , apples of lineendhere hesperides ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not one missing , still lineendhere transcendent , clustering like lineendhere a swarm of bees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yielding to no man's desire , glowing lineendhere with a saffron fire , splendid , unassailed , the lineendhere golden apples of hesperides ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere april had covered the hills with flickering lineendhere yellows and reds , the sparkle and coolness of snow lineendhere was blown from the mountain beds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere across a deep -- sunken stream the pink of lineendhere blossoming trees , and from windless appleblooms lineendhere the humming of many bees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the air was of rose and gold arabesqued lineendhere with the song of birds who , swinging unseen under leaves , lineendhere made music more eager than words . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of a sudden , aslant the road , a lineendhere brightness to dazzle and stun , a glint of the bluest lineendhere blue , a flash from a sapphire sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blue -- birds so blue , 't was a dream , an lineendhere impossible , unconceived hue , the high sky of summer lineendhere dropped down some rapturous ocean to woo . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such a colour , lineendhere such infinite lineendhere light ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the heart of a lineendhere fabulous gem , many -- faceted , lineendhere brilliant and rare . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere centre stone lineendhere of the earth's lineendhere diadem ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere centre stone of the lineendhere crown of the world , "sincerity" lineendhere graved on your youth ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and your eyes hold the lineendhere blue -- bird flash , the sapphire lineendhere shaft , which is truth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere life is a stream on which we strew petal by petal lineendhere the flower of our heart; the end lost in dream , they float past lineendhere our view , we only watch their glad , early start . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere freighted with hope , crimsoned with joy , we scatter lineendhere the leaves of our opening rose; their widening scope , lineendhere their distant employ , we never shall know . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the stream as it flows sweeps lineendhere them away , each one is gone ever lineendhere beyond into infinite ways . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we alone stay while years lineendhere hurry on , the flower fared forth , though lineendhere its fragrance still stays . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so through the vacancy of busy lineendhere life at intervals you cross my path and bring the lineendhere deep solemnity of passing years . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for you i have shed bitter tears , lineendhere for you i have relinquished that for which my lineendhere heart cried out in selfish longing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and to -- night having lineendhere just left you , i can say: lineendhere "'t is well . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thank god that i have known lineendhere a soul so true , so nobly just , lineendhere so worthy to be loved ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " stupefy my heart to every day's monotony , lineendhere seal up my eyes , i would not look so far , chasten my steps to peaceful lineendhere regularity , bow down my head lest i behold a star . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fill my days with work , a thousand calm necessities leaving lineendhere no moment to consecrate to hope , girdle my thoughts within the dull circumferences lineendhere of facts which form the actual in one short hour's scope . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere give me dreamless sleep , and loose night's power over me , shut lineendhere my ears to sounds only tumultuous then , bid fancy slumber , and steal away lineendhere its potency , or nature wakes and strives to live again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let each day pass , well ordered in its usefulness , lineendhere unlit by sunshine , unscarred by storm; dower me with strength and curb all foolish lineendhere eagerness -- the law exacts obedience . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high up above the open , lineendhere welcoming door it hangs , a piece lineendhere of wood with colours dim . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once , long ago , it was a waving lineendhere tree and knew the sun and shadow through the leaves of lineendhere forest trees , in a thick eastern wood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among its lineendhere branches , breaking here and there a limb; but every now and then broad lineendhere sunlit days lovingly lingered , caught among the leaves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an artist once , with patient , lineendhere careful knife , had fashioned it like to lineendhere the untamed sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here waves uprear themselves , their tops blown lineendhere back by the gay , sunny wind , which whips the blue and lineendhere breaks it into gleams and sparks of light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere among the flashing waves are lineendhere two white birds which swoop , and soar , and scream lineendhere for very joy at the wild sport . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now diving quickly lineendhere in , questing some glistening lineendhere fish . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now flying up , their dripping feathers shining lineendhere in the sun , while the wet drops like little glints of light , fall lineendhere pattering backward to the parent sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gliding along the green and foam -- flecked hollows , or lineendhere skimming some white crest about to break , the spirits of the sky deigning lineendhere to stoop and play with ocean in a summer mood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when you , my dear , are away , lineendhere away , how wearily goes lineendhere the creeping day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a year drags after morning , lineendhere and night starts another year lineendhere of candle light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o pausing lineendhere sun and lingering lineendhere moon ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grant me , i lineendhere beg of you , lineendhere this boon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whirl round the earth as never lineendhere sun has his diurnal lineendhere journey run . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and , moon , slip past the ladders of air in a lineendhere single flash , while your streaming hair catches the stars and pulls them down lineendhere to shine on some slumbering chinese town . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o lineendhere kindly lineendhere sun ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bring evening lineendhere to crowd the footsteps lineendhere of noon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but when that long lineendhere awaited day hangs ripe in the lineendhere heavens , your voyaging stay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere be lineendhere morning , lineendhere o sun ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with the lark in lineendhere song , be afternoon lineendhere for ages long . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and , moon , let you and lineendhere your lesser lights watch over lineendhere a century of nights . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here terrace sinks to terrace , arbors close the ends of lineendhere dreaming paths; a wanton wind jostles the half -- ripe pears , and then , unkind , tumbles a -- slumber lineendhere in a pillar rose , with content grown indolent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by night my garden lineendhere is o'erhung with gems fixed lineendhere in an onyx setting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fireflies lineendhere flicker their lanterns in lineendhere my dazzled eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in serried rows i lineendhere guess the straight , stiff stems of hollyhocks lineendhere against the rocks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who shall lineendhere declare the joy lineendhere of the running ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who shall tell lineendhere of the pleasures lineendhere of flight ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere springing and spurning the lineendhere tufts of wild heather , sweeping , wide -- winged , through lineendhere the blue dome of light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere everything mortal has lineendhere moments immortal , swift and god -- gifted , lineendhere immeasurably bright . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere joy in the lineendhere touch of the wind and lineendhere the sunlight ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with the vigorous lineendhere earth i am lineendhere one . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to be a flower nodding in the sun , bending , lineendhere then upspringing as the breezes run; holding up a scent -- brimmed cup , full lineendhere of summer's fragrance to the summer sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to be a butterfly still , lineendhere upon a flower , winking with its painted lineendhere wings , happy in the hour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blossoms hold mines of lineendhere gold deep within the farthest heart lineendhere of each chaliced flower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to be a cloud blowing through the blue , shadowing lineendhere the mountains , rushing loudly through valleys deep where torrents keep always lineendhere their plunging thunder and their misty arch of blue . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to be a wave splintering lineendhere on the sand , drawing back , but leaving lineendhere lingeringly the land . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rainbow light flashes lineendhere bright telling tales of coral caves lineendhere half hid in yellow sand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere soon they die , the flowers; insects lineendhere live a day; clouds dissolve in showers; only lineendhere waves at play last forever . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shall endeavor make lineendhere a sea of purpose mightier lineendhere than we dream to -- day? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he whistled a little frivolous tune which he felt lineendhere to be pulsing with ecstasy , for he thought that success always followed lineendhere desire , such a very superlative fool was he . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a maiden came by on an ambling lineendhere mule , her gown was rose -- red and her kerchief blue , on her lap lineendhere she carried a basket of eggs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thought the fool , lineendhere "there is certainly lineendhere room for two . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " so he jauntily swaggered lineendhere towards the maid and put out lineendhere his hand to the bridle -- rein . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "my pretty girl ," quoth the lineendhere fool , "take me up , for to ride with you lineendhere to the town i am fain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " but the maiden struck at his lineendhere upraised arm and pelted him hotly lineendhere with eggs , a score . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the mule , lashed into lineendhere a fury , ran; the fool went back lineendhere to his stone and swore . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then out of the cloud of settling lineendhere dust the burly form of an abbot appeared , reading lineendhere his office he rode to the town . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the lineendhere fool got up , for lineendhere his heart was cheered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he stood in the midst lineendhere of the long , white road and swept off his lineendhere cap till it touched the ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "ah , reverent sir , well lineendhere met ," said the fool , "a worthier transport lineendhere never was found . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "i pray you allow me to lineendhere mount with you , your palfrey seems lineendhere both sturdy and young . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " the abbot looked up lineendhere from the holy book and cried out in lineendhere anger , "hold your tongue ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "how dare you obstruct the king's lineendhere highroad , you saucy varlet , lineendhere get out of my way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " then he gave the fool a lineendhere cut with his whip and leaving him smarting , lineendhere he rode away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fool was angry , lineendhere the fool was sore , and he cursed lineendhere the folly of monks and maids . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "if i could but meet with a lineendhere man ," sighed the fool , "for a woman fears , lineendhere and a friar upbraids . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " then he saw a flashing of distant steel and the lineendhere clanking of harness greeted his ears , and up the road journeyed lineendhere knights -- at -- arms , with waving plumes and glittering spears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fool took notice lineendhere and slowly arose , not quite lineendhere so sure was his foolish heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if priests and women lineendhere would none of him was it likely lineendhere a knight would take his part? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they sang as they rode , these lusty boys , when lineendhere one chanced to turn toward the highway's side , "there's a sorry lineendhere figure of fun ," jested he , "well , sirrah ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere move back , there lineendhere is scarce room lineendhere to ride . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " then the lineendhere company halted lineendhere and laughed out loud . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "was such a lineendhere request ever lineendhere made to a knight? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "and where are your legs ," asked lineendhere one , "if you start , you may be inside lineendhere the town gates to -- night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "'t is a lazy fellow , let lineendhere him alone , they've no room in the town lineendhere for such idlers as he . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " but one bent from his saddle lineendhere and said , "my man , art thou not ashamed lineendhere to beg charity ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "thou art well set up , and thy legs are strong , but lineendhere it much misgives me lest thou'rt a fool; for beggars get only a beggar's lineendhere crust , wise men are reared in a different school . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere purple tree -- shadows crept over the road , the level lineendhere sun flung an orange light , and the fool laid his head on the hard , gray lineendhere stone and wept as he realized advancing night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a great , round moon rose over a hill and the lineendhere steady wind blew yet more cool; and crouched on a stone a wayfarer sobbed , lineendhere for at last he knew he was only a fool . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the stars hang thick in the apple lineendhere tree , the south wind smells of the pungent sea , gold lineendhere tulip cups are heavy with dew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the night's lineendhere for you , sweetheart , lineendhere for you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere starfire lineendhere rains from the vaulted lineendhere blue . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the dancing lineendhere of unseen lineendhere leaves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a drowsy lineendhere swallow stirs in the lineendhere eaves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only a lineendhere maiden is lineendhere sorrowing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 't is night lineendhere and spring , sweetheart , lineendhere and spring ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere starfire lineendhere lights your heart's lineendhere blossoming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the intimate dark there's never lineendhere an ear , though the tulips stand on tiptoe to hear , so lineendhere give; ripe fruit must shrivel or fall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as you lineendhere are mine , sweetheart , lineendhere give all ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere starfire lineendhere sparkles , your lineendhere coronal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineendhere is lineendhere poetry? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it a mosaic lineendhere of coloured stones which curiously lineendhere are wrought into a pattern? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere softly the water ripples against lineendhere the canoe's curving side , softly the birch trees rustle lineendhere flinging over us branches wide . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from the shore come the scents of a garden , lineendhere and between a gap in the trees a proud white statue lineendhere glimmers in cold , disdainful ease . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the child of a southern people , the thought lineendhere of an alien race , what does she in this pale , northern lineendhere garden , how reconcile it with her grace? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the moon in her wayward beauty is lineendhere ever and always the same , as lovely as when upon lineendhere latmos she watched till endymion came . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through the water the moon writes her legends lineendhere in light , on the smooth , wet sand; they endure for a moment , lineendhere and vanish , and no one may understand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all round us the secret of nature is telling lineendhere itself to our sight , we may guess at her meaning but lineendhere never can know the full mystery of night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but her power of enchantment is on us , lineendhere we bow to the spell which she weaves , made up of the murmur lineendhere of waves and the manifold whisper of leaves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to me lineendhere it is lineendhere not so . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to me alone it is a time of pause , a lineendhere void and silent space between two worlds , when inspiration lags , and feeling lineendhere sleeps , gathering strength for efforts yet to come . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for life alone is creator of life , and closest lineendhere contact with the human world is like a lantern shining in the lineendhere night to light me to a knowledge of myself . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as for a moment he stands , in hardy masculine beauty , lineendhere poised on the fircrested rock , over the pool which below him gleams in the lineendhere wavering sunlight , waiting the shock of his plunging . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so for a moment i stand , my feet lineendhere planted firm in the present , eagerly scanning the lineendhere future which is so soon to possess me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " later the solitude vanished , lineendhere confused and distracted the road where many lineendhere were seeking and jostling . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere left behind were the trees and the flowers , lineendhere the half -- realized beauty of quiet , the sacred lineendhere unconscious communing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and now he is come to a river , a lineendhere line of gray , sullen water , not blue and splashing , but dark , lineendhere rolling somberly on to the ocean . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but on the far side lineendhere is a city whose windows flame lineendhere gold in the sunset . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere be strong to uphold him , and bear him lineendhere across to the city , the beautiful city lineendhere whose spires still glow with the fires of sunset ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere look , dear , lineendhere how bright the moonlight lineendhere is to -- night ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see where it casts the lineendhere shadow of that tree far out lineendhere upon the grass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it seems as though the garden which you love were like lineendhere a swinging censer , its incense floating before us as a lineendhere reverent act to sanctify and bless our night of love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i need to hear it often lineendhere for my heart doubts naturally , lineendhere and finds it hard to trust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , dearest , you are good to love me so , and yet lineendhere i would not have it goodness , rather excess of selfishness in lineendhere you to need me through and through , as flowers need the sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere has your life too been lineendhere waiting for this time , not only lineendhere mine the sharpness of this joy? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dear heart , i love you , lineendhere worship you as though i were a priest lineendhere before a holy shrine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'm glad that you are beautiful , although were lineendhere you not lovely still i needs must love; but you are all things , it lineendhere must have been so for otherwise it were not you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere come , close; when you are in the circle lineendhere of my arm faith grows a mountain and i take my lineendhere stand upon its utmost top . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yes , yes , once more kiss me , and lineendhere let me feel you very near wanting me wholly , lineendhere even as i want you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere have lineendhere years behind lineendhere been dark? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere will those to come lineendhere bring unguessed sorrows into lineendhere our two lives? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what does lineendhere it matter , we lineendhere have had to -- night ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to -- night will make us lineendhere strong , for we believe each in the other , lineendhere this is a sacrament . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i know a country laced with roads , they join the lineendhere hills and they span the brooks , they weave like a shuttle between broad lineendhere fields , and slide discreetly through hidden nooks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are canopied like lineendhere a persian dome and carpeted lineendhere with orient dyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are myriad -- voiced , lineendhere and musical , and scented with lineendhere happiest memories . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o winding roads that lineendhere i know so well , every twist and lineendhere turn , every hollow and hill ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are set in my lineendhere heart to a pulsing tune gay as a lineendhere honey -- bee humming in june . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o uphill lineendhere roads and roads lineendhere that dip down ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you curl your sun -- spattered length along , and your march lineendhere is beaten into a song by the softly ringing hoofs of a lineendhere horse and the panting breath of the dogs i love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the pageant of autumn lineendhere follows its course and the blue sky of lineendhere autumn laughs above . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and the song and the country become as one , i see lineendhere it as music , i hear it as light; prismatic and shimmering , trembling lineendhere to tone , the land of desire , my soul's delight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and always it beats in my listening lineendhere ears with the gentle thud of a horse's stride , with the swift -- falling steps lineendhere of many dogs , following , following at my side . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o roads lineendhere that journey to lineendhere fairyland ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how lineendhere still it lineendhere is ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what sound is lineendhere that which echoes lineendhere through the wood? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it the lineendhere reedy note of an lineendhere oaten pipe? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere perchance a minute more will see the brood lineendhere of the shaggy forest god , and on his lip will lineendhere rest the rushes he is wont to play . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his train in woven baskets bear ripe fruit and weave a lineendhere dance with ropes of gray acorns , so light their touch the grasses scarcely lineendhere sway as they the measure tread to the lilting flute . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 't is only lineendhere fancy thus lineendhere adorns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a cloud drifts lineendhere idly over the lineendhere shining sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how damp lineendhere it seems , how silent , still , lineendhere and strange ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere surely 't was here some lineendhere tragedy was done , and here the lineendhere chorus sang each coming change? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the tread of lineendhere sandalled feet comes lineendhere noiselessly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the silence almost is a sound , and dreams take on lineendhere the semblances of finite things; so potent is the spell that what but lineendhere seems elsewhere , is lifted here on fancy's wings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the little woodland theatre seems to wait , all lineendhere tremulous with hope and wistful joy , for something that is sure to lineendhere come at last , some deep emotion , satisfying , great . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it grows a living presence , lineendhere bold and shy , cradling the future lineendhere in a glorious past . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the octagon tower casts a shade cool and lineendhere gray like a cutlass blade; in sun -- baked vines the cicalas spin , lineendhere the little green lizards run out and in . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a sail dips over lineendhere the ocean's rim , and bubbles lineendhere rise to the fountain's brim . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere slowly she walks to the balustrade , idly lineendhere notes how the blossoms fade in the sun's caress; then crosses where lineendhere the shadow shelters a carven chair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere within its curve , supine lineendhere she lies , and wearily closes lineendhere her tired eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the minstrel beseeches his silver strings , and holding the lady lineendhere spellbound , sings: -- down the road to avignon , the long , long road to avignon , across lineendhere the bridge to avignon , one morning in the spring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clouds sail over the distant trees , petals lineendhere are shaken down by the breeze , they fall on the terrace tiles lineendhere like snow; the sighing of waves sounds , far below . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a humming -- bird kisses lineendhere the lips of a rose then laden with honey lineendhere and love he goes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere step by step , and lineendhere he comes to her , fearful lest lineendhere she suddenly stir . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sunshine and silence , and each to each , the lineendhere lute and his singing their only speech; he leans above her , her eyes lineendhere unclose , the humming -- bird enters another rose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the minstrel lineendhere hushes his silver lineendhere strings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the beating lineendhere of humming -- birds' lineendhere wings ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down the road to avignon , the long , long lineendhere road to avignon , across the bridge to lineendhere avignon , one morning in the spring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hear the sigh the goaded lineendhere city gives , not day nor night can ease her lineendhere heart , her anguished labours stay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere below , straight streets , monotonous , from north and south , lineendhere from east and west , stretch glittering; and luminous above , one tower lineendhere tops the rest and holds aloft man's constant quest: time ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere joyless emblem of the greed of millions , robber lineendhere of the best which earth can give , the vulgar creed has seared upon lineendhere the night its flaming ruthless screed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whose soothing presence lineendhere brings the quiet shining lineendhere of the stars . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whose cloak of darkness clings so lineendhere intimately close that scars are lineendhere hid from our own eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beggars by day , our wealth is having night lineendhere to burn our souls before altars dim and tree -- shadowed , where the lineendhere light is shed from a young moon , mysteriously bright . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where art lineendhere thou hiding , lineendhere where thy peace? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this is the lineendhere hour , but lineendhere thou art not . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere will waking lineendhere tumult never lineendhere cease? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hast thou lineendhere thy votary lineendhere forgot? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nature forsakes this man -- begot and festering wilderness , lineendhere and now the long still hours are here , no jot of dear communing do lineendhere i know; instead the glaring , man -- filled city groans below ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on winter nights beside the lineendhere nursery fire we read the fairy lineendhere tale , while glowing coals builded its pictures . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the foliage seemed lineendhere to rustle in the wind , a silent lineendhere murmur , carved in still , gray stone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a sudden blare of trumpets , and lineendhere the throng about the entrance parted as the guests filed lineendhere singly in with rare and precious gifts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our eager fancies lineendhere noted all they brought , the glorious , lineendhere unattainable delights ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but always there was one lineendhere unbidden guest who cursed the child lineendhere and left it bitterness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fire falls asunder , all is lineendhere changed , i am no more a child , and what i see lineendhere is not a fairy tale , but life , my life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gifts are there , the many pleasant things: lineendhere health , wealth , long -- settled friendships , with a name which honors all who bear it , and lineendhere the power of making words obedient . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this is much; but overshadowing lineendhere all is still the curse , that never shall i lineendhere be fulfilled by love ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere along the parching lineendhere highroad of the world no other lineendhere soul shall bear mine company . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so i behold my visions on lineendhere the ground no longer radiant , an ignoble lineendhere heap of broken , dusty glass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and so , unlit , even by lineendhere hope or faith , my dragging steps force me lineendhere forever through the passing days . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you came to me bearing bright roses , red lineendhere like the wine of your heart; you twisted them into a garland lineendhere to set me aside from the mart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere red roses to crown lineendhere me your lover , and i walked lineendhere aureoled and apart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere enslaved and encircled , lineendhere i bore it , proud token of lineendhere my gift to you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the petals waned paler , lineendhere and shriveled , and dropped; and the lineendhere thorns started through . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bitter thorns to proclaim lineendhere me your lover , a diadem lineendhere woven with rue . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dear bessie , would my tired rhyme had force lineendhere to rise from apathy , and shaking off its lineendhere lethargy ring word -- tones like a christmas chime . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but in my soul's high belfry , chill the bitter lineendhere wind of doubt has blown , the summer swallows all have lineendhere flown , the bells are frost -- bound , mute and still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere upon the crumbling boards the snow lineendhere has drifted deep , the clappers hang prismed with icicles , lineendhere their clang unheard since ages long ago . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rope i pull is stiff and cold , my lineendhere straining ears detect no sound except a sigh , as round and lineendhere round the wind rocks through the timbers old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere below , i know the church is bright with lineendhere haloed tapers , warm with prayer; but here i only lineendhere feel the air of icy centuries of night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beneath my feet the snow is lit and lineendhere gemmed with colours , red , and blue , topaz , and green , where light lineendhere falls through the saints that in the windows sit . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here darkness seems a spectred thing , voiceless lineendhere and haunting , while the stars mock with a light of long lineendhere dead years the ache of present suffering . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere silent and winter -- killed i stand , no carol lineendhere hymns my debt to you; but take this frozen thought in lieu , lineendhere and thaw its music in your hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou father of the children of my brain by thee lineendhere engendered in my willing heart , how can i thank thee for this gift of lineendhere art poured out so lavishly , and not in vain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what thou created never more can die , thy lineendhere fructifying power lives in me and i conceive , knowing it lineendhere is by thee , dear other parent of my poetry ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all unknown , by me unguessed , by thee lineendhere not even dreamed , a tree has blossomed in a night lineendhere that seemed of stubborn , barren wood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for thou hast sown this lineendhere seed of beauty in lineendhere a ground of truth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere humbly i dedicate myself , and lineendhere yet i tremble with a sudden fear to set new lineendhere music ringing through my fading youth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his eyelids burnt and quivered with the lineendhere strain of looking , and against his temples beat the all lineendhere enshrouding , suffocating dark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he stumbled , lurched , and struck against a door that opened , lineendhere and a howl of obscene mirth grated his senses , wallowing on the lineendhere floor lay men , and dogs and women in the dirt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he sickened , loathing lineendhere it , and as he gazed the candle guttered , lineendhere flared , and then went out . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then as he leaned unconscious where , lineendhere the great oak door blew back and cast him , lineendhere bruised and dripping , in the church . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his eyes from long sojourning in lineendhere the night were blinded now as by some glorious sun; lineendhere he slowly crawled toward the altar steps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he could not think , for heavy in his lineendhere ears an organ boomed majestic harmonies; he lineendhere only knew that what he saw was light ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he bowed himself before lineendhere a cross of flame and shut his eyes lineendhere in fear lest it should fade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere blue through the window lineendhere burns the twilight; heavy , through trees , lineendhere blows the warm south wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere glistening , against lineendhere the chill , gray sky light , wet , black lineendhere branches are barred and entwined . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sodden and spongy , lineendhere the scarce -- green grass plot dents into lineendhere pools where a foot has been . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere puddles lie spilt in lineendhere the road a mass , not of water , lineendhere but steel , with its cold , hard sheen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere faint fades the fire lineendhere on the hearth , its embers lineendhere scattering wide at a stronger gust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above , the old weathercock lineendhere groans , but remembers creaking , to turn , in lineendhere its centuried rust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dying , forlorn , in dreary sorrow , wrapping the lineendhere mists round her withering form , day sinks down; and in darkness to -- morrow lineendhere travails to birth in the womb of the storm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere deeps of unhewn woods alone lineendhere can cherish thee , alone possess thy quiet , lineendhere teeming vigor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this our crime: not to have worshipped , marred lineendhere by alien moods that sole condition of all loveliness , lineendhere the dreaming lapse of slow , unmeasured time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dawn fills the room , and penetrating , lineendhere bright , the silent sunbeams through the lineendhere window pour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and she lies sleeping , ignorant lineendhere of fate , enmeshed in listless dreams , her soul not yet ripened lineendhere to bear the purport of this day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the morning breeze scarce stirs lineendhere the coverlet , a shadow falls lineendhere across the sunlight; wait ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a lark lineendhere is singing as lineendhere he flies away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beyond the ilex lineendhere shadow glares the sun , scorching against lineendhere the blue flame of the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere brown lily -- pads lie heavy and supine within lineendhere a granite basin , under one the bronze -- gold glimmer of a carp; lineendhere and i reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere another lineendhere year is quick with lineendhere import . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such lineendhere each year has lineendhere been . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere unmoved thou watchest all , and all bequeath lineendhere some jewel to thy diadem of power , thou pledge lineendhere of greater majesty unseen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a little garden on a lineendhere bleak hillside where deep the heavy , dazzling mountain lineendhere snow lies far into the spring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun's pale glow is scarcely lineendhere able to melt patches wide about lineendhere the single rose bush . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all denied lineendhere of nature's tender lineendhere ministries . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but no , -- for wonder -- working lineendhere faith has made it blow with flowers lineendhere many hued and starry -- eyed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a little lineendhere garden , loved with a lineendhere great love ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou yellow lineendhere trumpeter of lineendhere laggard spring ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thou herald of lineendhere rich summer's lineendhere myriad flowers ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere always bold to stand erect , lineendhere full in the dazzling play of april's lineendhere sun , for thou hast caught his gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 't is you that lineendhere are the music , lineendhere not your song . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the song is but a door which , opening lineendhere wide , lets forth the pent -- up melody inside , your spirit's lineendhere harmony , which clear and strong sings but of you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere throughout your whole life long your songs , your thoughts , your lineendhere doings , each divide this perfect beauty; waves within a tide , lineendhere or single notes amid a glorious throng . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the song of earth has many different lineendhere chords; ocean has many moods and many lineendhere tones yet always ocean . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the damp spring woods the painted lineendhere trillium smiles , while crisp pine cones autumn lineendhere alone can ripen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so is this one lineendhere music with a thousand lineendhere cadences . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so still it stands surely lineendhere our own if we exert lineendhere our might . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam , its glowing lineendhere flame would die if it were caught , its value is that it doth always lineendhere seem but just a little farther on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere distraught , but lighted ever lineendhere onward , we are brought upon our way lineendhere unknowing , in a dream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere brave idolatry lineendhere which can conceive lineendhere a hero ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no deceit , no knowledge taught lineendhere by unrelenting years , can quench this fierce , lineendhere untamable desire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we know that what we lineendhere long for once achieved will cease lineendhere to satisfy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere be still our fears; if what lineendhere we worship fail us , still the fire lineendhere burns on , and it is much to have believed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere must all of worth be travailled lineendhere for , and those life's brightest stars rise from lineendhere a troubled sea? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere must years go by in sad uncertainty lineendhere leaving us doubting whose the conquering lineendhere blows , are we or fate the victors? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere time which shows all inner lineendhere meanings will reveal , but we shall lineendhere never know the upshot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sudden we lack the flash lineendhere of insight , life grows drear and gray , and hour lineendhere follows hour , nerveless , slack . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere austere arbiter of each man's fate , by lineendhere whom he learns that nature's steadfast laws are as decrees immutable; lineendhere o pause your even forward march ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not yet too late teach me the needed lineendhere lesson , when to wait inactive as a ship when no lineendhere wind draws to stretch the loosened cordage . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what instinct forces lineendhere man to journey on , urged by a longing lineendhere blind but dominant ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nothing he sees can lineendhere hold him , nothing daunt his never lineendhere failing eagerness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun setting in splendour every night lineendhere has won his vassalage; those towers flamboyant of airy lineendhere cloudland palaces now haunt his daylight wanderings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wind is singing through the lineendhere trees to -- night , a deep -- voiced song of rushing lineendhere cadences and crashing intervals . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above the tossing trees shines down lineendhere a star , quietly bright; this wild , tumultuous lineendhere joy quickens nor dims its splendour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lineendhere my mind , o lineendhere star ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is filled with your white light , from far , lineendhere so suffer me this one night to enjoy the freedom lineendhere of the onward sweeping wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the path runs straight between the flowering rows , a lineendhere moonlit path , hemmed in by beds of bloom , where phlox and marigolds dispute lineendhere for room with tall , red dahlias and the briar rose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 't is reckless prodigality lineendhere which throws into the night these wafts of rich perfume lineendhere which sweep across the garden like a plume . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over lineendhere the trees a single lineendhere bright star glows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how is it that , being gone , lineendhere you fill my days , and all the long lineendhere nights are made glad by thee? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no loneliness is this , nor misery , but great content lineendhere that these should be the ways whereby the fancy , dreaming as she strays , lineendhere makes bright and present what she would would be . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and who shall say if lineendhere the reality is not lineendhere with dreams so pregnant . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " it may lineendhere be vain lineendhere illusion . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alas , how few there are who strike in lineendhere us a chord we knew existed , but so seldom lineendhere heard its tone we tremble at the half -- forgotten sound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the world is full of rude awakenings and heaven -- born lineendhere castles shattered to the ground , yet still our human longing vainly lineendhere clings to a belief in beauty through all wrongs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o stay lineendhere your hand , and leave lineendhere my heart its songs ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what torture lurks within a single thought when lineendhere grown too constant , and however kind , however welcome lineendhere still , the weary mind aches with its presence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dull remembrance taught remembers on unceasingly; unsought lineendhere the old delight is with us but to find that all recurring joy is lineendhere pain refined , become a habit , and we struggle , caught . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you lie upon my heart as on a nest , folded lineendhere in peace , for you can never know how crushed i am with lineendhere having you at rest heavy upon my life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i love you so lineendhere you bind my freedom from lineendhere its rightful quest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in mercy lineendhere lift your drooping wings lineendhere and go . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i do not care to talk to you although your lineendhere speech evokes a thousand sympathies , and all my being's silent lineendhere harmonies wake trembling into music . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when you go it is as if some lineendhere sudden , dreadful blow had severed all lineendhere the strings with savage ease . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no , do not talk; but let lineendhere us rather seize this intimate lineendhere gift of silence which we know . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere others may guess your thoughts lineendhere from what you say , as storms are guessed lineendhere from clouds where darkness broods . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to me the very essence of the day reveals lineendhere its inner purpose and its moods; as poplars feel the rain and then straightway lineendhere reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now you lineendhere are lineendhere come ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you tremble like a lineendhere star poised where , behind earth's lineendhere rim , the sun has set . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere your voice has sung across lineendhere my heart , but numb and mute , i have lineendhere no tones to answer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere far within i kneel before lineendhere you , speechless yet , and life ablaze with lineendhere beauty , i am dumb . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how empty lineendhere seems the town now lineendhere you are gone ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a wilderness of sad streets , where gaunt walls hide nothing lineendhere to desire; sunshine falls eery , distorted , as it long lineendhere had shone on white , dead faces tombed in halls of stone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the whir of motors , stricken through with lineendhere calls of playing boys , floats up at intervals; but all lineendhere these noises blur to one long moan . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what quest lineendhere is worth lineendhere pursuing? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and how strange lineendhere that other men still go lineendhere accustomed ways ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hate their interest lineendhere in the things they lineendhere do . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a spectre -- horde lineendhere repeating without change lineendhere an old routine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alone i know lineendhere the days are still -- born , and the lineendhere world stopped , lacking you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all night i wrestled with lineendhere a memory which knocked insurgent lineendhere at the gates of thought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought its lineendhere disillusion; now i only cry for peace , for power to lineendhere forget the lie which hope too long has whispered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so i sought the sleep which lineendhere would not come , and night was fraught with old lineendhere emotions weeping silently . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i heard your voice again , lineendhere and knew the things which you had promised lineendhere proved an empty vaunt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i felt your clinging lineendhere hands while night's broad wings cherished lineendhere our love in darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from the lawn a lineendhere sudden , quivering lineendhere birdnote , like a taunt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my arms lineendhere held nothing but lineendhere the empty dawn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to make a pavement for your feet lineendhere i stripped my soul for you to walk upon , and slipped lineendhere beneath your steps to soften all your ways . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but now my letters lineendhere are like blossoms pale we strew upon lineendhere a grave with hopeless tears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i ask no recompense , i shall not fail although lineendhere you do not heed; the long , sad years still pass , and still i scatter flowers lineendhere frail , and whisper words of love which no one hears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere throughout the echoing chambers of my lineendhere brain i hear your words in mournful cadence toll like some slow lineendhere passing -- bell which warns the soul of sundering darkness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere unrelenting , fain to batter down resistance , fall lineendhere again stroke after stroke , insistent diastole , the bitter blows of truth , lineendhere until the whole is hammered into fact made strangely plain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where shall lineendhere i look for lineendhere comfort? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our worlds are drawn lineendhere apart , our spirit's suns divided , lineendhere and the light of mine burnt dim . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now in the haunted lineendhere twilight i must lineendhere do your will . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i grasp the cup which lineendhere over -- runs , and with my trembling lineendhere lips i touch the rim . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "'i can't lineendhere get out', said the lineendhere starling . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " sterne's lineendhere 'sentimental lineendhere journey'. lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere forever the impenetrable wall of self confines lineendhere my poor rebellious soul , i never see the towering white clouds roll before lineendhere a sturdy wind , save through the small barred window of my jail . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i live a thrall with all my outer life lineendhere a clipped , square hole , rectangular; a fraction of a scroll lineendhere unwound and winding like a worsted ball . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my thoughts are grown uneager and lineendhere depressed through being always mine , my fancy's wings are lineendhere moulted and the feathers blown away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i weary for desires never lineendhere guessed , for alien passions , strange imaginings , to lineendhere be some other person for a day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere white , glittering sunlight lineendhere fills the market square , spotted lineendhere and sprigged with shadows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the market glows , lineendhere and flaunts , and clatters in lineendhere its busy care . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the law of duty urged that he lineendhere should roam , should sail from fog and chilly airs to lineendhere skies clear with deceitful welcome . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he had come with proud resolve , lineendhere but still his lonely eyes ached with fatigue lineendhere at never seeing home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere smoulderings of sacrificial lineendhere fires burst their rings and blotted out lineendhere in smoke his lost domain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bereft of courtiers , lineendhere only with his queen , from empty lineendhere palace down to empty quay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no challenge lineendhere screamed from hostile lineendhere carabine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere boyish , lineendhere sympathetic lineendhere man ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere crumbled before lineendhere thy majesty lineendhere we bow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the little gallery winds round about lineendhere the middle of a most secluded room , midway between lineendhere the ceiling and the floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for books are more than books , they are the life , the very lineendhere heart and core of ages past , the reason why men lived , and worked , and lineendhere died , the essence and quintessence of their lives . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere silently waiting that from time to time it may be lineendhere given them to illuminate dull daily facts with pristine radiance for lineendhere some long -- waited -- for affinity who lingers yet in the deep womb of time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the shifting sun pierces the young green leaves of lineendhere elm trees , newly coming into bud , and splashes on the floor and on lineendhere the books through old , high , rounded windows , dim with age . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the noisy city -- sounds of modern lineendhere life float softened to us across lineendhere the old graveyard . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the room is filled with a warm , mellow lineendhere light , no garish colours jar on our content , lineendhere the books upon the shelves are old and worn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 't was no belated effort nor attempt to lineendhere keep abreast with old as well as new that placed them here , tricked in a lineendhere modern guise , easily got , and held in light esteem . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a nothing truly , yet a link that binds all lineendhere ages to their own inheritance , and stretching backward , dim and lineendhere dimmer still , is lost in a remote antiquity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grapes do not come of thorns nor figs of lineendhere thistles , and even a great poet's divinest thought lineendhere is coloured by the world he knows and sees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nay , the little things of daily lineendhere life it is which mold , and shape , and make him apt lineendhere for noble deeds and true . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the long , still , fruitful hours slip away shedding lineendhere their influences as they pass; we know ourselves the richer lineendhere to have sat upon this dusty floor and dreamed our dreams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no other place to us lineendhere were quite the same , no other dreams so potent lineendhere in their charm , for this is ours ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the building simply bodies lineendhere forth a thought peculiarly lineendhere inherent to the race . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and we , descendants of that elder lineendhere time , have learnt to love the very form in which the thought lineendhere has been embodied to our years . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it takes some time for moss and vines lineendhere to grow and warmly cover gaunt and chill stone walls lineendhere of stately buildings from the cold north wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lichen of affection takes as long , or lineendhere longer , ere it lovingly enfolds a place which since without it were lineendhere bereft , all stript and bare , shorn of its chiefest grace . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sea shell , sea lineendhere shell , sing me a lineendhere song , o please ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sea shell , sea lineendhere shell , sing of the things lineendhere you know so well . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere near where i live there is a lineendhere lake as blue as blue can be , winds make lineendhere it dance as they go blowing by . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i think lineendhere it curtseys to lineendhere the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it's just a lake of lovely flowers and lineendhere my mamma says they are ours; but they are not like lineendhere those we grow to be our very own , you know . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we have a splendid garden , there are lots lineendhere of flowers everywhere; roses , and pinks , and four o'clocks lineendhere and hollyhocks , and evening stocks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mamma lets us lineendhere pick them , but never must we lineendhere pick any gentians -- ever ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for if we carried lineendhere them away they'd die of lineendhere homesickness that day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my grandpapa lives in a wonderful house lineendhere with a great many windows and doors , there are stairs that go up , and lineendhere stairs that go down , and such beautiful , slippery floors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but of all of the rooms , even mother's and mine , lineendhere and the bookroom , and parlour and all , i like the green dining -- room so lineendhere much the best because of its ceiling and wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere right over your head is a funny round hole with lineendhere apples and pears falling through; there's a big bunch of grapes all purply lineendhere and sweet , and melons and pineapples too . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they tumble and tumble , but never come down though i've lineendhere stood underneath a long while with my mouth open wide , for i always lineendhere have hoped just a cherry would drop from the pile . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no matter how early i run there to look it lineendhere has always begun to fall through; and one night when at bedtime i lineendhere crept in to see , it was falling by candle -- light too . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am sure they are magical fruits , and each lineendhere one makes you hear things , or see things , or go forever invisible; lineendhere but it's no use , and of course i shall just never know . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for the ladder's too heavy lineendhere to lift , and the chairs are not nearly lineendhere so tall as i need . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i've given up hope , and lineendhere i feel i shall die without having lineendhere accomplished the deed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it's a little bit sad , when you seem very near lineendhere to adventures and things of that sort , which nearly begin , and then lineendhere don't; and you know it is only because you are short . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere slipping softly through the lineendhere sky little horned , happy moon , can you lineendhere hear me up so high? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere will you lineendhere come down lineendhere soon? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on my nursery lineendhere window -- sill will you stay lineendhere your steady flight? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and then float away lineendhere with me through the lineendhere summer night? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere brushing over tops of trees , playing lineendhere hide and seek with stars , peeping up through shiny lineendhere clouds at jupiter or mars . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shall fill my lap with roses lineendhere gathered in the milky way , all to lineendhere carry home to mother . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what will lineendhere she lineendhere say ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere little rocking , lineendhere sailing moon , do you hear lineendhere me shout -- ahoy ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere just a little lineendhere nearer , moon , to please lineendhere a little boy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high up in the apple lineendhere tree climbing i go , with the sky lineendhere above me , the earth below . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere each branch is the step of lineendhere a wonderful stair which leads to the lineendhere town i see shining up there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere climbing , climbing , higher and higher , the branches lineendhere blow and i see a spire , the gleam of a turret , the glint of a lineendhere dome , all sparkling and bright , like white sea foam . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on and on , from bough to bough , the leaves are thick , lineendhere but i push my way through; before , i have always had to stop , lineendhere but to -- day i am sure i shall reach the top . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere today to the end of lineendhere the marvelous stair , where those glittering lineendhere pinacles flash in the air ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere climbing , climbing , higher lineendhere i go , with the sky close above lineendhere me , the earth far below . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere naughty little lineendhere speckled trout , can't i lineendhere coax you to come out? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it such great fun lineendhere to play in the water lineendhere every day? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do you pull the lineendhere naiads' hair hiding lineendhere in the lilies there? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do you hunt for lineendhere fishes' eggs , or watch lineendhere tadpoles grow their legs? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do the little trouts have school in some lineendhere deep sun -- glinted pool , and in recess play at tag lineendhere round that bed of purple flag? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have tried so hard to catch you , lineendhere hours and hours i've sat to watch you; but you never lineendhere will come out , naughty little speckled trout ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he shouts in the sails of the ships at sea , he lineendhere steals the down from the honeybee , he makes the forest trees rustle lineendhere and sing , he twirls my kite till it breaks its string . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere laughing , dancing , sunny wind , whistling , lineendhere howling , rainy wind , north , south , east and west , each is lineendhere the wind i like the best . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he calls up the fog and hides the hills , he whirls lineendhere the wings of the great windmills , the weathercocks love him and turn to lineendhere discover his whereabouts -- but he's gone , the rover ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the pine trees toss him their cones with glee , the lineendhere flowers bend low in courtesy , each wave flings up a shower lineendhere of pearls , the flag in front of the school unfurls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by day you cannot lineendhere see the sky for it is lineendhere up so very high . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you look and look , lineendhere but it's so blue that you lineendhere can never see right through . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but when night comes it lineendhere is quite plain , and all the lineendhere stars are there again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they seem just like old lineendhere friends to me , i've known them lineendhere all my life you see . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is the dipper first , and there is lineendhere cassiopeia in her chair , orion's belt , the lineendhere milky way , and lots i know but cannot say . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one group looks like a swarm of bees , papa lineendhere says they're the pleiades; but i think they must be the lineendhere toy of some nice little angel boy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere perhaps his jackstones which to -- day he has lineendhere forgot to put away , and left them lying on the lineendhere sky where he will find them bye and bye . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wish he'd lineendhere come and play lineendhere with me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we'd have such fun , for it would lineendhere be a most unusual thing for boys lineendhere to feel that they had stars for toys ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “we grasp our battle -- spears: lineendhere we don our lineendhere breast -- plates of hide . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the axles of lineendhere our chariots touch: our lineendhere short swords meet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere standards obscure the lineendhere sun: the foe roll lineendhere up like clouds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere arrows fall thick: lineendhere the warriors lineendhere press forward . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they menace lineendhere our ranks: they break lineendhere our line . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the left -- hand trace -- horse lineendhere is dead: the one on lineendhere the right is smitten . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fallen horses lineendhere block our wheels: they impede lineendhere the yoke -- horses ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” they grasp their jade lineendhere drum -- sticks: they beat the lineendhere sounding drums . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere heaven decrees their lineendhere fall: the dread powers lineendhere are angry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the warriors lineendhere are all dead: they lie lineendhere on the moor -- field . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they issued but shall lineendhere not enter: they went but lineendhere shall not return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the plains are lineendhere flat and wide: the lineendhere way home is long . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their swords lie beside lineendhere them: their black bows , in lineendhere their hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though their limbs were lineendhere torn , their hearts could not lineendhere be repressed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they were more than lineendhere brave: they were inspired with lineendhere the spirit of “wu . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” steadfast to the lineendhere end , they could not lineendhere be daunted . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their bodies were stricken , but their lineendhere souls have taken immortality -- captains among lineendhere the ghosts , heroes among the dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to be an orphan , lineendhere to be fated to lineendhere be an orphan . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how lineendhere bitter is this lineendhere lot ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when my father and mother lineendhere were alive i used to ride in a carriage lineendhere with four fine horses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but when they both died , lineendhere my brother and sister -- in -- law sent me out lineendhere to be a merchant . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the south i travelled lineendhere to the “nine rivers” and in the east as lineendhere far as ch’i and lu . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my brother lineendhere told me to get lineendhere ready the dinner . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my sister -- in -- law lineendhere told me to see after lineendhere the horses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i was always going up lineendhere into the hall and running down lineendhere again to the parlour . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my lineendhere tears fell lineendhere like rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the morning they lineendhere sent me to draw water , i lineendhere didn’t get back till night -- fall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my hands lineendhere were all sore and lineendhere i had no shoes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i walked the cold lineendhere earth treading on thorns lineendhere and brambles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as i stopped to lineendhere pull out the thorns , how lineendhere bitter my heart was ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my tears fell and lineendhere fell and i went on lineendhere sobbing and sobbing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in winter i lineendhere have no great -- coat; nor in lineendhere summer , thin clothes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is lineendhere no pleasure to be lineendhere alive . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i had rather quickly lineendhere leave the earth and go beneath lineendhere the yellow springs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the april winds blow lineendhere and the grass is lineendhere growing green . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the third month -- silkworms lineendhere and mulberries , in lineendhere the sixth month -- the melon -- harvest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i went out with the melon -- cart lineendhere and just as i was coming home the lineendhere melon -- cart turned over . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the people who came to help me were few , but lineendhere the people who ate the melons were many , all they left me lineendhere was the stalks -- to take home as fast as i could . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my brother and sister -- in -- law lineendhere were harsh , they asked me all sorts lineendhere of awful questions . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why does lineendhere everyone in the lineendhere village hate me? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i want to write a letter and send it to my mother lineendhere and father under the earth , and tell them i can’t go on any lineendhere longer living with my brother and sister -- in -- law . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she had been ill for years lineendhere and years; she sent for me lineendhere to say something . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she couldn’t say what she lineendhere wanted because of the tears that lineendhere kept coming of themselves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “i have burdened you with lineendhere orphan children , with orphan lineendhere children two or three . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere don’t let our children lineendhere go hungry or cold; if they do lineendhere wrong , don’t slap or beat them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when you take lineendhere out the baby , rock lineendhere it in your arms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” last she said , “when i carried them in lineendhere my arms they had no clothes and now their lineendhere jackets have no linings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _ i shut the doors and lineendhere barred the windows and left the lineendhere motherless children . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i got lineendhere to the market and met lineendhere my friends , i wept . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i sat down lineendhere and could not go lineendhere with them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i asked them lineendhere to buy some cakes for lineendhere my children . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the presence lineendhere of my friends i lineendhere sobbed and cried . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i tried not lineendhere to grieve , but sorrow lineendhere would not cease . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i felt in lineendhere my pocket and gave my lineendhere friends some money . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i got home i found lineendhere my children calling to be taken lineendhere into their mother’s arms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i walked up and down lineendhere in the empty room this way lineendhere and that a long while . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then i went away from lineendhere it and said to myself “i will forget lineendhere and never speak of her again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” in the eastern lineendhere quarter dawn breaks , the stars lineendhere flicker pale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the morning cock lineendhere at ju -- nan mounts the lineendhere wall and crows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the songs are over , lineendhere the clock run down , but still lineendhere the feast is set . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the moon grows dim lineendhere and the stars are few; morning lineendhere has come to the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at a thousand gates and ten thousand lineendhere doors the fish -- shaped keys turn; round the palace and up by the lineendhere castle , the crows and magpies are flying . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we go to the lineendhere golden palace: we lineendhere set out the jade cups . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we summon the lineendhere honoured guests to enter lineendhere at the golden gate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they enter at the lineendhere golden gate and go to lineendhere the golden hall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the eastern kitchen the lineendhere meat is sliced and ready -- roast beef lineendhere and boiled pork and mutton . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the master lineendhere of the feast hands round lineendhere the wine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the harp -- players lineendhere sound their clear lineendhere chords . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cups are pushed aside and lineendhere we face each other at chess: the rival lineendhere pawns are marshalled rank against rank . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fire glows and the lineendhere smoke puffs and curls; from the incense -- burner rises lineendhere a delicate fragrance . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the clear wine has made lineendhere our cheeks red; round the table lineendhere joy and peace prevail . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere may those who shared in this lineendhere day’s delight through countless autumns enjoy lineendhere like felicity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at fifteen i lineendhere went with the army , at lineendhere fourscore i came home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the way i met a man lineendhere from the village , i asked him lineendhere who there was at home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “that over there is your lineendhere house , all covered over with lineendhere trees and bushes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” rabbits had run in lineendhere at the dog -- hole , pheasants flew down from lineendhere the beams of the roof . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the courtyard was growing lineendhere some wild grain; and by the well , lineendhere some wild mallows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i’ll boil the grain and lineendhere make porridge , i’ll pluck the lineendhere mallows and make soup . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere soup and porridge lineendhere are both cooked , but there is no lineendhere one to eat them with . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i went out and looked lineendhere towards the east , while tears fell lineendhere and wetted my clothes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in a narrow road where there lineendhere was not room to pass my carriage met lineendhere the carriage of a young man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and while his axle was touching lineendhere my axle in the narrow road i lineendhere asked him where he lived . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “the place where i live is easy lineendhere enough to find , easy to find and lineendhere difficult to forget . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the midst of the courtyard grows lineendhere a cassia -- tree , -- and candles on its branches lineendhere flaring away in the night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” they fought south lineendhere of the castle , they died lineendhere north of the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they died lineendhere in the moors and were lineendhere not buried . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their flesh lineendhere was the lineendhere food of crows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “tell the crows we are not lineendhere afraid; we have died in the moors lineendhere and cannot be buried . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere crows , how can our lineendhere bodies escape lineendhere you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” the waters flowed deep lineendhere and the rushes in lineendhere the pool were dark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the riders fought lineendhere and were slain: their horses lineendhere wander neighing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by the lineendhere bridge there was lineendhere a house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere was it lineendhere south , was it lineendhere north? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the harvest lineendhere was never lineendhere gathered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how can lineendhere we give you your lineendhere offerings? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you served your lineendhere prince faithfully , lineendhere though all in vain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i think of you , faithful lineendhere soldiers; your service shall not lineendhere be forgotten . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for in the morning you lineendhere went out to battle and at lineendhere night you did not return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i went out at lineendhere the eastern gate: i never lineendhere thought to return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i came back to lineendhere the gate with my heart lineendhere full of sorrow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there was not a peck of lineendhere rice in the bin: there was not a coat lineendhere hanging on the pegs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so i took lineendhere my sword and went lineendhere towards the gate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my wife and child clutched at my coat lineendhere and wept: “some people want to be rich and grand: i only lineendhere want to share my porridge with you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above , we have the blue waves lineendhere of the sky: below , the yellow lineendhere face of this little child . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” “dear wife , lineendhere i cannot lineendhere stay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere soon lineendhere it will be lineendhere too late . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when one is growing lineendhere old one cannot put lineendhere things off . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” she went up the mountain to pluck lineendhere wild herbs; she came down the mountain and lineendhere met her former husband . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she knelt down and asked lineendhere her former husband “what do you lineendhere find your new wife like? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” “my new wife , although her lineendhere talk is clever , cannot charm me lineendhere as my old wife could . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in beauty of lineendhere face there is not lineendhere much to choose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but in usefulness lineendhere they are not at lineendhere all alike . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my new wife comes in from lineendhere the road to meet me; my old wife always lineendhere came down from her tower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my new wife is clever lineendhere at embroidering silk; my old lineendhere wife was good at plain sewing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of silk embroidery one lineendhere can do an inch a day; of plain lineendhere sewing , more than five feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere putting her silks by the side lineendhere of your sewing , i see that the new lineendhere will not compare with the old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” my love is lineendhere living to the lineendhere south of the great sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what shall lineendhere i send lineendhere to greet him? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere two pearls and a comb lineendhere of tortoise -- shell: i’ll send them to him packed lineendhere in a box of jade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they tell me he is not true: they tell me lineendhere he dashed my box to the ground , dashed it to the ground and burnt lineendhere it and scattered its ashes to the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from this day to the ends lineendhere of time i must never think of him , lineendhere never again think of him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cocks are crowing , and lineendhere the dogs are barking -- my brother lineendhere and his wife will soon know . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the autumn wind is lineendhere blowing; the morning lineendhere wind is sighing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in a moment the lineendhere sun will rise in the east and lineendhere then _it_ too will know . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am a prisoner lineendhere in the hands of the enemy , enduring lineendhere the shame of captivity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my bones stick out and lineendhere my strength is gone through not getting lineendhere enough to eat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my brother is a lineendhere mandarin and his horses lineendhere are fed on maize . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why can’t he spare a lineendhere little money to send lineendhere and ransom me? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if you were riding in a coach lineendhere and i were wearing a “li ,” and one day we met lineendhere in the road , you would get down and bow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if you were carrying a “tēng” and i lineendhere were riding on a horse , and one day we met in lineendhere the road i would get down for you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i want to be your lineendhere friend for ever and ever without lineendhere break or decay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how swiftly it dries , the lineendhere dew on the garlic -- leaf , the dew that dries lineendhere so fast to -- morrow will fall again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but he whom we lineendhere carry to the grave will never lineendhere more return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what man’s lineendhere land is the lineendhere graveyard? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is the crowded lineendhere home of ghosts , -- wise and foolish lineendhere shoulder to shoulder . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the king of the lineendhere dead claims them all; man’s fate lineendhere knows no tarrying . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on and on , always lineendhere on and on away from you , lineendhere parted by a life -- parting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere going from one another lineendhere ten thousand “li ,” each in a different lineendhere corner of the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the way between is lineendhere difficult and long , face to face lineendhere how shall we meet again? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere since we parted the time lineendhere is already long , daily my lineendhere clothes hang looser round my waist . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere floating clouds obscure the lineendhere white sun , the wandering one lineendhere has quite forgotten home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thinking of you has made lineendhere me suddenly old , the months and lineendhere years swiftly draw to their close . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i’ll put you out of my lineendhere mind and forget for ever and try lineendhere with all my might to eat and thrive . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere green , green , lineendhere the grass by the lineendhere river -- bank . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thick , thick , the lineendhere willow trees in lineendhere the garden . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sad , sad , lineendhere the lady in lineendhere the tower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere white , white , lineendhere sitting at the casement lineendhere window . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fair , fair , lineendhere her red -- powdered lineendhere face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere small , small , lineendhere she puts out her lineendhere pale hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once she lineendhere was a lineendhere dancing -- house girl . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now she lineendhere is a wandering lineendhere man’s wife . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wandering lineendhere man went , but did lineendhere not return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is hard lineendhere alone to keep lineendhere an empty bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere green , green , the lineendhere cypress on lineendhere the mound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere firm , firm , lineendhere the boulder lineendhere in the stream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere man’s life lived within this lineendhere world , is like the sojourning of lineendhere a hurried traveller . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a cup of wine together lineendhere will make us glad , and a little lineendhere friendship is no little matter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yoking my lineendhere chariot i urge my stubborn lineendhere horses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wander lineendhere about in the streets lineendhere of wan and lo . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in lo town lineendhere how fine lineendhere everything is ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the “caps and lineendhere belts” go seeking lineendhere each other out . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the great boulevards are lineendhere intersected by lanes , wherein lineendhere are the town -- houses of royal dukes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the two palaces stare lineendhere at each other from afar , the lineendhere twin gates rise a hundred feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by prolonging the feast lineendhere let us keep our hearts gay , and leave lineendhere no room for sadness to creep in . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of this day’s glorious lineendhere feast and revel the pleasure and delight lineendhere are difficult to describe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere plucking the lute they sent lineendhere forth lingering sounds , the new melodies lineendhere in beauty reached the divine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere skilful singers intoned lineendhere the high words , those who knew the tune heard lineendhere the trueness of their singing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we sat there each with the same desire and lineendhere like thoughts by each unexpressed: “man in the world lodging for a single life -- time lineendhere passes suddenly like dust borne on the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then let us hurry out with high steps and be lineendhere the first to reach the highways and fords: rather than stay at home lineendhere wretched and poor for long years plunged in sordid grief . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” in the north -- west there is lineendhere a high house , its top level lineendhere with the floating clouds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere embroidered curtains thinly lineendhere screen its windows , its storied tower lineendhere is built on three steps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from above there comes lineendhere a noise of playing and singing , lineendhere the tune sounding , oh ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who can it lineendhere be , playing so sad lineendhere a tune? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere surely it lineendhere must be ch’i liang’s lineendhere wife . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the tranquil “d” follows lineendhere the wind’s rising , the middle lineendhere lay lingers indecisive . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to each note , two or lineendhere three sobs , her high will conquered by lineendhere overwhelming grief . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she does not regret that she lineendhere is left so sad , but minds that so few lineendhere can understand her song . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she wants to become lineendhere those two wild geese that with beating lineendhere wings rise high aloft . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere crossing the river i lineendhere pluck hibiscus -- flowers: in the orchid -- swamps lineendhere are many fragrant herbs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i gather lineendhere them , but who shall lineendhere i send them to? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my love lineendhere is living in lands lineendhere far away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i turn and look towards lineendhere my own country: the long road lineendhere stretches on for ever . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the same heart , yet a different lineendhere dwelling: always fretting , till lineendhere we are grown old ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a bright moon illumines lineendhere the night -- prospect: the house -- cricket chirrups on lineendhere the eastern wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the handle of the lineendhere pole -- star points to the beginning lineendhere of winter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the host of stars lineendhere is scattered over lineendhere the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the white dew wets the lineendhere moor -- grasses , -- with sudden swiftness the lineendhere times and seasons change . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the autumn cicada lineendhere sings among the trees , the swallows , lineendhere alas , whither are they gone? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once i had a lineendhere same -- house friend , he took flight and lineendhere rose high away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he did not remember how lineendhere once we went hand in hand , but left me like lineendhere footsteps behind one in the dust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the south is the winnowing -- fan lineendhere and the pole -- star in the north , and a herd -- boy whose ox lineendhere has never borne the yoke . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a friend who is not firm as lineendhere a great rock is of no profit lineendhere and idly bears the name . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the courtyard there grows lineendhere a strange tree , its green leaves ooze lineendhere with a fragrant moisture . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere holding the branch i cut a lineendhere flower from the tree , meaning to send it away lineendhere to the person i love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere its sweet lineendhere smell fills my sleeves lineendhere and lap . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the road is lineendhere long , how shall i get lineendhere it there? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere such a thing is not fine enough lineendhere to send: but it may remind him of the time lineendhere that has past since he left . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere far away twinkles the lineendhere herd -- boy star; brightly shines the lady lineendhere of the han river . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere slender , slender lineendhere she plies her white lineendhere fingers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere click , click go lineendhere the wheels of her lineendhere spinning -- loom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the end of the day lineendhere she has not finished her task; her bitter lineendhere tears fall like streaming rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the han river runs lineendhere shallow and clear; set between lineendhere them , how short a space ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the river water will not lineendhere let them pass , gazing at each other lineendhere but never able to speak . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere turning my lineendhere chariot i yoke my lineendhere horses and go . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on and on down the lineendhere long roads the autumn winds shake lineendhere the hundred grasses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on every lineendhere side , how desolate lineendhere and bare ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the things i meet are lineendhere all new things , their strangeness hastens lineendhere the coming of old age . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere prosperity lineendhere and decay each have their lineendhere season . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere success is bitter lineendhere when it is slow lineendhere in coming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere man’s life is not metal lineendhere or stone , he cannot far prolong lineendhere the days of his fate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly lineendhere he follows in the lineendhere way of things that change . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fame is the lineendhere only treasure that lineendhere endures . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the eastern castle lineendhere stands tall and high; far and wide lineendhere stretch the towers that guard it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the whirling wind uprises lineendhere and shakes the earth; the autumn grasses lineendhere grow thick and green . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the four seasons alternate lineendhere without pause , the year’s end hurries lineendhere swiftly on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the bird of the morning wind lineendhere is stricken with sorrow; the frail lineendhere cicada suffers and is hard pressed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere free and clear , let lineendhere us loosen the lineendhere bonds of our hearts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why should we lineendhere go on always lineendhere restraining and binding? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in yen and chao are lineendhere many fair ladies , beautiful people lineendhere with faces like jade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their clothes lineendhere are made all of lineendhere silk gauze . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they stand at lineendhere the door practising lineendhere tranquil lays . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the echo lineendhere of their singing , lineendhere how sad it sounds ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by the pitch of lineendhere the song one knows the lineendhere stops have been tightened . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to ease their minds they arrange lineendhere their shawls and belts; lowering their song , a lineendhere little while they pause . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “i should like to be those two flying lineendhere swallows who are carrying clay to lineendhere nest in the eaves of your house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” i drive my chariot up to lineendhere the eastern gate; from afar i see lineendhere the graveyard north of the wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the white aspens how they lineendhere murmur , murmur; pines and cypresses lineendhere flank the broad paths . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beneath lie men who lineendhere died long ago; black , black is lineendhere the long night that holds them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere deep down beneath the lineendhere yellow springs , thousands of lineendhere years they lie without waking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in infinite succession lineendhere light and darkness shift , and years vanish lineendhere like the morning dew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere man’s life is like a sojourning , lineendhere his longevity lacks the firmness lineendhere of stone and metal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for ever it has been lineendhere that mourners in their turn were mourned , saint lineendhere and sage , -- all alike are trapped . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere seeking by food to obtain lineendhere immortality many have lineendhere been the dupe of strange drugs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere better far to drink lineendhere good wine and clothe our bodies lineendhere in robes of satin and silk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the dead are gone and lineendhere with them we cannot lineendhere converse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the living are lineendhere here and ought to have lineendhere our love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere leaving the city -- gate i look lineendhere ahead and see before me lineendhere only mounds and tombs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old graves are ploughed lineendhere up into fields , the pines and cypresses lineendhere are hewn for timber . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the white aspens sad lineendhere winds sing; their long murmuring lineendhere kills my heart with grief . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i want to go lineendhere home , to ride to my lineendhere village gate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i want to go lineendhere back , but there’s no lineendhere road back . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the years of a lineendhere lifetime do not lineendhere reach a hundred . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yet they contain lineendhere a thousand years’ lineendhere sorrow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when days are short and lineendhere the dull nights long , why not take a lineendhere lamp and wander forth? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if you want to be happy lineendhere you must do it now , there is no lineendhere waiting till an after -- time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fool who’s loath to lineendhere spend the wealth he’s got becomes the laughing -- stock lineendhere of after ages . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is true that master lineendhere wang became immortal , but how can lineendhere _we_ hope to share his lot? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cold , cold the year draws to its lineendhere end , the crickets and grasshoppers lineendhere make a doleful chirping . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the chill wind lineendhere increases its lineendhere violence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my wandering lineendhere love has no coat to lineendhere cover him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he gave his embroidered furs lineendhere to the lady of lo , but from me his lineendhere bedfellow he is quite estranged . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sleeping alone in the depth lineendhere of the long night in a dream i thought lineendhere i saw the light of his face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my dear one thought of our lineendhere old joys together , he came in his lineendhere chariot and gave me the front reins . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wanted so to prolong lineendhere our play and laughter , to hold his lineendhere hand and go back with him in his coach . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but , when he had come he lineendhere would not stay long nor stop to go with me lineendhere to the inner chamber . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere truly without the falcon’s lineendhere wings to carry me how can i rival lineendhere the flying wind’s swiftness? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i go and lean at the lineendhere gate and think of my grief , my falling lineendhere tears wet the double gates . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the beginning of lineendhere winter a cold spirit comes , lineendhere the north wind blows -- chill , chill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my sorrows being many , i lineendhere know the length of the nights , raising my head i lineendhere look at the stars in their places . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the fifteenth day the bright lineendhere moon is full , on the twentieth lineendhere day the “toad and hare” wane . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” i put the letter away lineendhere in the folds of my dress , for three years the lineendhere writing did not fade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how with an undivided lineendhere heart i loved you i fear that you lineendhere will never know or guess . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the bright moon , oh , how white lineendhere it shines , shines down on the gauze lineendhere curtains of my bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere racked by sorrow lineendhere i toss and cannot lineendhere sleep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere picking up lineendhere my clothes , i wander lineendhere up and down . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my absent love says that he lineendhere is happy , but i would rather he lineendhere said he was coming back . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere out in the courtyard lineendhere i stand hesitating , lineendhere alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to whom lineendhere can i tell the sad lineendhere thoughts i think? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere staring before me i lineendhere enter my room again; falling lineendhere tears wet my mantle and robe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere autumn wind lineendhere rises: white lineendhere clouds fly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grass and lineendhere trees wither: lineendhere geese go south . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere orchids all lineendhere in bloom: chrysanthemums lineendhere smell sweet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i think of my lineendhere lovely lady: i never lineendhere can forget . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere across the mid -- stream white waves rise flute and lineendhere drum keep time to sound of the rowers’ song; amidst revel lineendhere and feasting , sad thoughts come; youth’s years how few ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sound lineendhere of her silk lineendhere skirt has stopped . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the marble lineendhere pavement dust lineendhere grows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her empty lineendhere room is cold lineendhere and still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fallen leaves are lineendhere piled against lineendhere the doors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere longing for that lovely lineendhere lady how can i bring my lineendhere aching heart to rest? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it lineendhere or isn’t lineendhere it? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lineendhere stand lineendhere and look . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the swish , lineendhere swish of lineendhere a silk skirt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how slow lineendhere she lineendhere comes ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our love was pure as the snow on the mountains: lineendhere white as a moon between the clouds -- they’re telling me your thoughts lineendhere are double that’s why i’ve come to break it off . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to -- day we’ll lineendhere drink a cup lineendhere of wine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to -- morrow we’ll part beside the canal: lineendhere walking about beside the canal , where its lineendhere branches divide east and west . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alas lineendhere and alas , and lineendhere again alas . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so must a girl cry when she’s married , lineendhere if she find not a man of single heart , who will lineendhere not leave her till her hair is white . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere since our hair was plaited and lineendhere we became man and wife the love between lineendhere us was never broken by doubt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so let us be merry lineendhere this night together , feasting and lineendhere playing while the good time lasts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i suddenly remember the lineendhere distance that i must travel; i spring from lineendhere bed and look out to see the time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the stars and planets are all lineendhere grown dim in the sky; long , long is lineendhere the road; i cannot stay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am going on lineendhere service , away to the battle -- ground , and i lineendhere do not know when i shall come back . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hold your hand with only lineendhere a deep sigh; afterwards , tears -- in the days lineendhere when we are parted . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with all your might enjoy the lineendhere spring flowers , but do not forget lineendhere the time of our love and pride . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere know that if i live , i will come lineendhere back again , and if i die , we will go lineendhere on thinking of each other . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the good time will never lineendhere come back again: in a moment , -- our parting lineendhere will be over . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere anxiously -- we halt at the lineendhere road -- side , hesitating -- we embrace lineendhere where the fields begin . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the clouds above are floating lineendhere across the sky: swiftly , swiftly passing: lineendhere or blending together . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the waves in the wind lose lineendhere their fixed place and are rolled away each lineendhere to a corner of heaven . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from now onwards -- long lineendhere must be our lineendhere parting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so let us lineendhere stop again for lineendhere a little while . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wish i could ride on lineendhere the wings of the morning wind and go with lineendhere you right to your journey’s end . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i came ten thousand leagues across lineendhere sandy deserts in the service of lineendhere my prince , to break the hun tribes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my way was lineendhere blocked and barred , my arrows lineendhere and sword broken . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my armies had lineendhere faded away , my lineendhere reputation had gone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my old lineendhere mother is lineendhere long dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere although i want lineendhere to requite my prince how lineendhere can i return? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my people have married me in a lineendhere far corner of earth: sent me away to a lineendhere strange land , to the king of the wu -- sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a tent is my house , lineendhere of felt are my walls; raw flesh my lineendhere food with mare’s milk to drink . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere always thinking lineendhere of my own country , my lineendhere heart sad within . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere would i were a lineendhere yellow stork and could lineendhere fly to my old home ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere solemn , solemn the lineendhere coachman gets ready to go: lineendhere “chiang , chiang” the harness bells ring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at break of dawn i lineendhere must start on my long journey: at cock -- crow lineendhere i must gird on my belt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i turn back and look at lineendhere the empty room: for a moment i lineendhere almost think i see you there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one parting , but ten thousand lineendhere regrets: as i take my seat , my lineendhere heart is unquiet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what shall lineendhere i do to tell lineendhere you all my thoughts? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how can lineendhere i let you know of all lineendhere my love? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere precious hairpins make lineendhere the head to shine and bright mirrors lineendhere can reflect beauty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fragrant herbs banish lineendhere evil smells and the scholar’s lineendhere harp has a clear note . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the man in the book of odes who lineendhere was given a quince wanted to pay it lineendhere back with diamonds and rubies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i think of all the things you lineendhere have done for me , how ashamed i am lineendhere to have done so little for you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere although i know that it is lineendhere a poor return , all i can give you is this lineendhere description of my feelings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my poor body is lineendhere alas unworthy: i was ill when lineendhere first you brought me home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere limp and weary lineendhere in the house -- time passed and lineendhere i got no better . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we could hardly ever lineendhere see each other: i could not lineendhere serve you as i ought . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then you received the imperial lineendhere mandate: you were ordered to go far lineendhere away to the city . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere long , long must be our lineendhere parting: i was not destined lineendhere to tell you my thoughts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i stood on tiptoe gazing lineendhere into the distance , interminably gazing lineendhere at the road that had taken you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with thoughts of you my mind is lineendhere obsessed: in my dreams i see lineendhere the light of your face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now you are started on lineendhere your long journey each day brings lineendhere you further from me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh that i had lineendhere a bird’s wings and high flying lineendhere could follow you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere long i sob and lineendhere long i cry: the tears fall lineendhere down and wet my skirt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the eastern way at the city of lineendhere lo -- yang at the edge of the road peach -- trees and plum -- trees grow; on the two sides , -- flower matched lineendhere by flower; across the road , -- leaf touching leaf . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a spring wind rises lineendhere from the north -- east; flowers and leaves lineendhere gently nod and sway . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere up the road somebody’s lineendhere daughter comes carrying a basket , lineendhere to gather silkworms’ food . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (_she sees the fruit trees in blossom lineendhere and , forgetting about her silkworms , begins lineendhere to pluck the branches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _) with her slender hand she lineendhere breaks a branch from the tree; the flowers lineendhere fall , tossed and scattered in the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “lovely lady , i never lineendhere did you harm; why should you hate lineendhere me and do me injury? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though in the autumn your lineendhere leaves patter to the ground , when spring lineendhere comes , your gay bloom returns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but in men’s lives when their lineendhere bright youth is spent joy and love never lineendhere come back again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” when i was young , throughout lineendhere the hot season there were no carriages lineendhere driving about the roads . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere people shut their doors and lineendhere lay down in the cool: or if they went lineendhere out , it was not to pay calls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nowadays -- ill -- bred , ignorant lineendhere fellows , when they feel the heat , lineendhere make for a friend’s house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the unfortunate host , lineendhere when he hears someone coming scowls and frowns , lineendhere but can think of no escape . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “there’s nothing for it but to rise lineendhere and go to the door ,” and in his comfortable lineendhere seat he groans and sighs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the conversation lineendhere does not end quickly: prattling and babbling , lineendhere what a lot he says ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only when one is almost lineendhere dead with fatigue he asks at last if lineendhere one isn’t finding him tiring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere (one’s arm is almost in half lineendhere with continual fanning: the sweat is pouring lineendhere down one’s neck in streams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) do not say that this is a lineendhere small matter: i consider the practice lineendhere a blot on our social life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i therefore caution lineendhere all wise men that august visitors lineendhere should not be admitted . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i look up and see / his lineendhere curtains and bed: i look down and examine lineendhere / his table and mat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the things lineendhere are there / just as lineendhere before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the man lineendhere they belonged to / is lineendhere not there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his spirit suddenly lineendhere / has taken flight and left me behind lineendhere / far away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to whom shall lineendhere i look / on lineendhere whom rely? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my tears flow lineendhere / in an endless lineendhere stream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “yu , yu” / cry the wandering lineendhere deer as they carry fodder lineendhere / to their young in the wood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere flap , flap / fly the birds lineendhere as they carry their little lineendhere ones / back to the nest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i alone / am desolate lineendhere dreading the days / of our long parting: my grieving lineendhere heart’s / settled pain no one else / can understand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is a saying lineendhere / among people “sorrow makes lineendhere us / grow old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” alas , lineendhere alas / for lineendhere my white hairs ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all too lineendhere early lineendhere / they have come ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere long wailing , / long lineendhere sighing my thoughts are fixed on lineendhere my sage parent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they say the lineendhere good / live long: then why lineendhere was he / not spared? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my charioteer hastens lineendhere to yoke my carriage , for i must go lineendhere on a journey far away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “where are you going lineendhere on your journey lineendhere far away? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” to the land lineendhere of wu where my lineendhere enemies are . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i must ride many lineendhere thousand miles , beyond the lineendhere eastern road that leads to wu . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i want to take a skiff lineendhere and cross these rivers , but alas for lineendhere me , where shall i find a boat? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to sit idle is not my lineendhere desire: gladly enough would i lineendhere go to my country’s aid . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the north -- west there is lineendhere a floating cloud stretched on high , like lineendhere a chariot’s canvas -- awning . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alas that i was born in lineendhere these times , to be blown along like lineendhere a cloud puffed by the wind ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it has blown me away lineendhere far to the south -- east , on and on lineendhere till i came to wu -- hui . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wu -- hui is not my country: lineendhere why should i go on staying lineendhere and staying here? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will give it up and never lineendhere speak of it again , -- this being abroad lineendhere and always living in dread . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i climb to the ridge of pei lineendhere mang mountain and look down on lineendhere the city of lo -- yang . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in lo -- yang lineendhere how still it lineendhere is ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere palaces and lineendhere houses all burnt lineendhere to ashes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere walls and fences all lineendhere broken and gaping , thorns and brambles lineendhere shooting up to the sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i do not see the lineendhere old old -- men: i only see lineendhere the new young men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i turn aside , for the straight lineendhere road is lost: the fields are overgrown and lineendhere will never be ploughed again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have been away such lineendhere a long time that i do not lineendhere know which street is which . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how sad and lineendhere ugly the empty lineendhere moors are ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a thousand miles lineendhere without the smoke of a lineendhere chimney . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i think of the house lineendhere i lived in all those years: i am lineendhere heart -- tied and cannot speak . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “wondrous was the wall -- stone , weirdly broken; lineendhere burgh -- steads bursten , giants’ work tumbleth , roofs are wrenched , lineendhere towers totter , bereft of rune -- gates . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere smoke is on the plaster , lineendhere scarred the shower -- burghs , shorn and shattered , lineendhere by eld under -- eaten . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere earth’s grip lineendhere haveth wealders and lineendhere workmen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” our wandering lineendhere eyes are sated with lineendhere the dancer’s skill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our ears are lineendhere weary with the lineendhere sound of “kung” and “shang . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” our host is silent lineendhere and sits doing nothing: all the guests go lineendhere on to places of amusement . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on long benches the lineendhere sportsmen sit ranged round a cleared room , lineendhere watching the fighting -- cocks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gallant birds are lineendhere all in battle -- trim: they raise their tails and lineendhere flap defiantly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their beating wings stir lineendhere the calm air: their angry eyes lineendhere gleam with a red light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where their beaks have struck , the fine feathers lineendhere are scattered: with their strong talons they lineendhere wound again and again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their long cries enter the lineendhere blue clouds; their flapping wings lineendhere tirelessly beat and throb . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “pray god the lamp -- oil lasts a little lineendhere longer , then i shall not leave without lineendhere winning the match ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” in the nine provinces there is not room enough: i lineendhere want to soar high among the clouds , and , far beyond the eight limits of the lineendhere compass , cast my gaze across the unmeasured void . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the doors of heaven lineendhere swing open , the double gates lineendhere shine with a red light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lord god lies at his western lineendhere lattice: and the lesser spirits are together lineendhere in the eastern gallery . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they wash me in a bath lineendhere of rainbow -- spray and gird me with a lineendhere belt of jasper and rubies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wander at my ease lineendhere gathering divine herbs: i bend down lineendhere and touch the scented flowers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wang -- tzŭ gives me drugs lineendhere of long -- life and hsien -- mēn lineendhere hands me strange potions . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by the partaking of food i evade lineendhere the rites of death: my span is extended to the lineendhere enjoyment of life everlasting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere flap , flap , you curtain lineendhere in front of our lineendhere bed ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i hung you there lineendhere to screen us from lineendhere the light of day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i brought you with me when i lineendhere left my father’s house; now i am lineendhere taking you back with me again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will fold lineendhere you up and lay you lineendhere flat in your box . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere curtain -- shall i lineendhere ever take you out lineendhere again? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i was young i lineendhere learnt fencing and was better at lineendhere it than crooked castle . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my spirit was high lineendhere as the rolling clouds and my fame lineendhere resounded beyond the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i took my sword to lineendhere the desert sands , i drank my lineendhere horse at the nine moors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my flags and banners lineendhere flapped in the wind , and nothing was heard lineendhere but the song of my drums . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere war and its travels have made me sad , and a lineendhere fierce anger burns within me: it’s thinking of how i’ve wasted lineendhere my time that makes this fury tear my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will cast lineendhere out wisdom and lineendhere reject learning . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my thoughts lineendhere shall wander in lineendhere the great void (_bis_). lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere always repenting lineendhere of wrongs done will never bring lineendhere my heart to rest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i cast my hook in a single lineendhere stream; but my joy is as though i lineendhere possessed a kingdom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i loose my hair and lineendhere go singing; to the four frontiers lineendhere men join in my refrain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this is the purport lineendhere of my song: “my thoughts shall wander lineendhere in the great void . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” a gentle wind fans lineendhere the calm night: a bright moon shines lineendhere on the high tower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a voice whispers , but no one lineendhere answers when i call: a shadow stirs , but lineendhere no one comes when i beckon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the kitchen -- man brings in lineendhere a dish of lentils: wine is there , lineendhere but i do not fill my cup . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere contentment with poverty lineendhere is fortune’s best gift: riches and honour are lineendhere the handmaids of disaster . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though gold and gems by the lineendhere world are sought and prized , to me they lineendhere seem no more than weeds or chaff . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how sad it is lineendhere to be a lineendhere woman ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nothing lineendhere on earth is held lineendhere so cheap . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere boys stand leaning lineendhere at the door like gods fallen lineendhere out of heaven . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their hearts brave the four lineendhere oceans , the wind and dust of lineendhere a thousand miles . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no one is glad when lineendhere a girl is born: by _her_ the lineendhere family sets no store . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when she grows up , she hides lineendhere in her room afraid to look lineendhere a man in the face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no one cries when lineendhere she leaves her home -- sudden lineendhere as clouds when the rain stops . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she bows her head and composes lineendhere her face , her teeth are pressed on her red lips: lineendhere she bows and kneels countless times . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she must humble lineendhere herself even to lineendhere the servants . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _his_ love is distant as lineendhere the stars in heaven , yet the sunflower lineendhere bends toward the sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their hearts more sundered than water lineendhere and fire -- a hundred evils lineendhere are heaped upon her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her face will follow lineendhere the years’ changes: her lord lineendhere will find new pleasures . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they that were once like lineendhere substance and shadow are now lineendhere as far as hu from ch’in . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yet hu and ch’in shall sooner lineendhere meet than they whose parting is like lineendhere ts’an and ch’ēn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i was young i played with lineendhere a soft brush and was passionately lineendhere devoted to reading all sorts of books . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but then the arrows lineendhere began singing at lineendhere the frontier . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and a winged summons lineendhere came flying to the lineendhere city . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere although arms were lineendhere not my profession , i had lineendhere once read jang -- chū’s war -- book . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i shouted aloud and my cries lineendhere rent the air: i felt as though tung wu were lineendhere already annihilated . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the scholar’s knife cuts best at its lineendhere first use and my dreams hurried on to lineendhere the completion of my plan . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wanted at a stroke to lineendhere clear the yang -- tze and hsiang , and at a glance to lineendhere quell the tibetans and hu . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when my task was done , i should not accept lineendhere a barony , but refusing with a bow , retire lineendhere to a cottage in the country . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere flap , flap , the captive bird lineendhere in the cage beating its wings lineendhere against the four corners . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere depressed , depressed the scholar lineendhere in the narrow street: clasping a shadow , lineendhere he dwells in an empty house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when he goes out , there is nowhere lineendhere for him to go: bunches and brambles lineendhere block up his path . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he composes a memorial , lineendhere but it is rejected and unread , he is left stranded , lineendhere like a fish in a dry pond . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere without -- he has not a single farthing lineendhere of salary: within -- there is not a peck lineendhere of grain in his larder . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his relations upbraid him lineendhere for his lack of success: his friends and callers lineendhere daily decrease in number . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i once hoped to pluck lineendhere the fruits of life: but now alas , lineendhere they are all withered and dry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though one drinks at a river , one cannot lineendhere drink more than a bellyful; enough is good , but lineendhere there is no use in satiety . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the bird in a forest can lineendhere perch but on one bough , and this should lineendhere be the wise man’s pattern . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at pei -- mang how they rise lineendhere to heaven , those high mounds , four lineendhere or five in the fields ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what men lie lineendhere buried under lineendhere these tombs? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all of lineendhere them were lords lineendhere of the han world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the dynasty was falling , lineendhere tumult and disorder arose , thieves and lineendhere robbers roamed like wild beasts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of earth they have carried away lineendhere more than one handful , they have gone into lineendhere vaults and opened the secret doors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over everything the lineendhere tangled thorns are growing: a herd -- boy pushes lineendhere through them up the path . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down in the thorns rabbits lineendhere have made their burrows: the weeds and thistles lineendhere will never be cleared away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over the tombs the ploughshare lineendhere will be driven and peasants will have their lineendhere fields and orchards there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they that were once lords of a lineendhere thousand hosts are now become the dust lineendhere of the hills and ridges . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” when i was alive , i wandered in lineendhere the streets of the capital: now that i am lineendhere dead , i am left to lie in the fields . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the morning i drove lineendhere out from the high hall: in the evening i lineendhere lodged beneath the yellow springs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the white sun had sunk in lineendhere the western chasm i hung up my chariot lineendhere and rested my four horses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , even the mighty lineendhere maker of all could not bring the lineendhere life back to my limbs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shape and substance day lineendhere by day will vanish: hair and teeth will lineendhere gradually fall away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere forever from of lineendhere old men have been so: and none lineendhere born can escape this thing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere living in retirement beyond the world , lineendhere silently enjoying isolation , i pull the rope of my door lineendhere tighter and stuff my window with roots and ferns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my spirit is tuned to lineendhere the spring -- season: at the fall of the lineendhere year there is autumn in my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thus imitating lineendhere cosmic changes my cottage becomes lineendhere a universe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shady , shady the wood lineendhere in front of the hall: at midsummer lineendhere full of calm shadows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the south wind follows summer’s lineendhere train: with its eddying -- puffs it blows lineendhere open my coat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am free from lineendhere ties and can live a life of lineendhere retirement . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i rise lineendhere from sleep , i play with lineendhere books and harp . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lettuce in the garden lineendhere still grows moist: of last year’s grain there is lineendhere always plenty left . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere self -- support should maintain strict lineendhere limits: more than enough lineendhere is not what i want . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i grind millet and make lineendhere good wine: when the wine is heated , lineendhere i pour it out for myself . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my little children are lineendhere playing at my side , learning to lineendhere talk , they babble unformed sounds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these things have made me happy lineendhere again and i forget my lineendhere lost cap of office . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere distant , distant i gaze at the white lineendhere clouds: with a deep yearning i think of the lineendhere sages of antiquity . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the quiet of the morning lineendhere i heard a knock at my door: i threw on my lineendhere clothes and opened it myself . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i asked who it was who had come so lineendhere early to see me: he said he was a peasant , lineendhere coming with good intent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he brought a present of lineendhere wine and rice -- soup , believing that i had lineendhere fallen on evil days . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “you live in rags under a lineendhere thatched roof and seem to have no lineendhere desire for a better lot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rest of mankind have lineendhere all the same ambitions: you , too , must lineendhere learn to wallow in their mire . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” “old man , i am impressed lineendhere by what you say , but my soul is lineendhere not fashioned like other men’s . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to drive in their rut i might lineendhere perhaps learn: to be untrue to myself lineendhere could only lead to muddle . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let us drink and enjoy together lineendhere the wine you have brought: for my course is set and lineendhere cannot now be altered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” a long time ago i went lineendhere on a journey , right to the corner lineendhere of the eastern ocean . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the road there was lineendhere long and winding , and stormy lineendhere waves barred my path . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what made me lineendhere go this lineendhere way? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hunger drove lineendhere me into lineendhere the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i tried hard to fill lineendhere my belly: and even a lineendhere little seemed a lot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but this was clearly lineendhere a bad bargain , so i went lineendhere home and lived in idleness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high and low , wise and lineendhere simple , all busily hoard lineendhere up the moments of life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere therefore i have to the uttermost exposed the lineendhere bitterness both of substance and shadow , and have made spirit show how , lineendhere by following nature , we may dissolve this bitterness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere heaven and earth exist lineendhere for ever: mountains and rivers lineendhere never change . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but herbs and trees in perpetual rotation lineendhere are renovated and withered by the dews and frosts: and man the wise , lineendhere man the divine -- shall he alone escape this law? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fortuitously appearing lineendhere for a moment in the world he suddenly lineendhere departs , never to return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how can he know that lineendhere the friends he has left are missing lineendhere him and thinking of him? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only the things that lineendhere he used remain; they look upon lineendhere them and their tears flow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere me no magical lineendhere arts can save , though you may hope lineendhere for a wizard’s aid . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i beg you listen lineendhere to this advice -- when you can get lineendhere wine , be sure to drink it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is lineendhere no way to preserve lineendhere life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere drugs of lineendhere immortality lineendhere are instruments of folly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i would gladly wander lineendhere in paradise , but it is far lineendhere away and there is no road . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere since the day that i lineendhere was joined to you we have shared lineendhere all our joys and pains . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while you rested in the shade , lineendhere i left you a while: but till the end lineendhere we shall be together . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our joint existence lineendhere is impermanent: sadly together lineendhere we shall slip away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that when the body decays fame lineendhere should also go is a thought lineendhere unendurable , burning the heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let us strive and lineendhere labour while yet we may to lineendhere do some deed that men will praise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wine may in truth dispel lineendhere our sorrow , but how compare lineendhere it with lasting fame? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere god can only set lineendhere in motion: he cannot control lineendhere the things he has made . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere man , the second lineendhere of the three orders , owes his lineendhere precedence to me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere though i am different from you , we were lineendhere born involved in one another: nor by any means can we lineendhere escape the intimate sharing of good and ill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the three lineendhere emperors were saintly lineendhere men , yet to -- day -- where are they? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere p’ēng lived to a lineendhere great age , yet he went at last , when lineendhere he longed to stay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and late or soon , lineendhere all go: wise and simple lineendhere have no reprieve . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wine may bring lineendhere forgetfulness , but does lineendhere it not hasten old -- age? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if you set your heart lineendhere on noble deeds , how do you lineendhere know that any will praise you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere chill and harsh the year draws lineendhere to its close: in my cotton dress lineendhere i seek sunlight on the porch . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the southern orchard lineendhere all the leaves are gone: in the north lineendhere garden rotting boughs lie heaped . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i empty my cup and lineendhere drink it down to the dregs: i look towards lineendhere the kitchen , but no smoke rises . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere poems and books lie piled beside lineendhere my chair: but the light is going and i shall lineendhere not have time to read them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my life here is not like the lineendhere agony in ch’ēn , but often i lineendhere have to bear bitter reproaches . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let me then remember , to lineendhere calm my heart’s distress , that the sages lineendhere of old were often in like case . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere white hair covers my temples , i am lineendhere wrinkled and seared beyond repair , and though i have lineendhere got five sons , they all hate paper and brush . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a -- shu is eighteen: for lineendhere laziness there is lineendhere none like him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a -- hsüan does his lineendhere best , but really lineendhere loathes the fine arts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but lineendhere does not lineendhere know “six” from “seven . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” t’ung -- tzŭ in his ninth lineendhere year is only concerned lineendhere with things to eat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if heaven treats lineendhere me like this , what can i lineendhere do but fill my cup? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i built my hut in a zone lineendhere of human habitation , yet near me there lineendhere sounds no noise of horse or coach . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere would you know lineendhere how that is lineendhere possible? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a heart that is lineendhere distant creates a lineendhere wilderness round it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i pluck chrysanthemums under lineendhere the eastern hedge , then gaze long at the lineendhere distant summer hills . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the mountain air is fresh at lineendhere the dusk of day: the flying birds lineendhere two by two return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in these things there lies a lineendhere deep meaning; yet when we would express it , lineendhere words suddenly fail us . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my old desire to live in the lineendhere southern village was not because i had taken lineendhere a fancy to the house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i heard it was a place lineendhere of simple -- minded men with whom it were a joy to lineendhere spend the mornings and evenings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere many years i had longed lineendhere to settle here: now at last i have lineendhere managed to move house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i do not mind if my cottage lineendhere is rather small so long as there’s room enough lineendhere for bed and mat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere often and often the lineendhere neighbours come to see me and with brave words lineendhere discuss the things of old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rare writings we read together lineendhere and praise: doubtful meanings we examine lineendhere together and settle . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i was young , i was out lineendhere of tune with the herd: my only love lineendhere was for the hills and mountains . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere unwitting i fell into lineendhere the web of the world’s dust and was not lineendhere free until my thirtieth year . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the migrant bird longs lineendhere for the old wood: the fish in the tank thinks lineendhere of its native pool . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i had rescued from wildness a patch lineendhere of the southern moor and , still rustic , i lineendhere returned to field and garden . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my ground covers no more than lineendhere ten acres: my thatched cottage lineendhere has eight or nine rooms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere elms and willows cluster lineendhere by the eaves: peach trees and plum trees lineendhere grow before the hall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hazy , hazy lineendhere the distant hamlets lineendhere of men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere steady the smoke of the half -- deserted village , lineendhere a dog barks somewhere in the deep lanes , a cock crows at lineendhere the top of the mulberry tree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at gate and courtyard -- no murmur lineendhere of the world’s dust: in the empty lineendhere rooms -- leisure and deep stillness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere long i lived checked by the lineendhere bars of a cage: now i have turned again lineendhere to nature and freedom . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the month of june the lineendhere grass grows high and round my cottage lineendhere thick -- leaved branches sway . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is not a bird but delights lineendhere in the place where it rests: and i lineendhere too -- love my thatched cottage . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have done lineendhere my ploughing: i lineendhere have sown my seed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere again i have lineendhere time to sit and lineendhere read my books . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the narrow lane there are lineendhere no deep ruts: often my friends’ lineendhere carriages turn back . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in high spirits i pour lineendhere out my spring wine and pluck the lineendhere lettuce growing in my garden . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a gentle rain comes stealing lineendhere up from the east and a sweet wind bears lineendhere it company . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my thoughts float idly over the story lineendhere of king chou my eyes wander over the lineendhere pictures of hills and seas . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at a single lineendhere glance i survey the whole lineendhere universe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he will never be lineendhere happy , whom such pleasures lineendhere fail to please ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lingering clouds , rolling , lineendhere rolling , and the settled rain , dripping , dripping , lineendhere in the eight directions -- the same dusk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the level lineendhere lands -- one great lineendhere river . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wine i have , wine i lineendhere have: idly i drink at the lineendhere eastern window . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere longingly -- i think lineendhere of my friends , but neither lineendhere boat nor carriage comes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere swiftly lineendhere the years , beyond lineendhere recall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere solemn the stillness lineendhere of this fair lineendhere morning . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will clothe myself lineendhere in spring -- clothing and visit the lineendhere slopes of the eastern hill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by the mountain -- stream a lineendhere mist hovers , hovers a moment , lineendhere then scatters . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there comes a wind blowing lineendhere from the south that brushes the lineendhere fields of new corn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i collected lineendhere together all lineendhere my friends . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere loud talk and simple feasting: lineendhere discussion of philosophy , lineendhere investigation of subtleties . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tongues loosened lineendhere and minds at lineendhere one . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hearts refreshed lineendhere by discharge of lineendhere emotion ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere high rises the lineendhere eastern peak soaring up lineendhere to the blue sky . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere among the rocks -- an lineendhere empty hollow , secret , lineendhere still , mysterious ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere uncarved and unhewn , lineendhere screened by nature with a lineendhere roof of clouds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere times and seasons , what lineendhere things are you bringing to my lineendhere life ceaseless change? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will lodge for ever lineendhere in this hollow where springs lineendhere and autumns unheeded pass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all night i could lineendhere not sleep because of the lineendhere moonlight on my bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i kept on hearing lineendhere a voice calling: out of nowhere , lineendhere nothing answered “yes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” i will carry my coat and lineendhere not put on my belt; with unpainted eyebrows lineendhere i will stand at the front window . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my tiresome petticoat lineendhere keeps on flapping about; if it opens a little , lineendhere i shall blame the spring wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i heard my love was lineendhere going to yang -- chou and went with lineendhere him as far as ch’u -- shan . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for a moment when you held lineendhere me fast in your outstretched arms i thought the river lineendhere stood still and did not flow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have brought my pillow and am lineendhere lying at the northern window , so come to lineendhere me and play with me awhile . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with so much quarrelling lineendhere and so few kisses how long do you lineendhere think our love can last? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her door opened on the white water close lineendhere by the side of the timber bridge: that’s where the little lady lineendhere lived all alone without a lover . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere green rushes with red shoots , long leaves lineendhere bending to the wind -- you and i in the same boat lineendhere plucking rushes at the five lakes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we started at dawn from lineendhere the orchid -- island: we rested under lineendhere the elms till noon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you and i plucking lineendhere rushes had not plucked a handful lineendhere when night came ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “seeing the plum -- tree i thought of the western lineendhere island and i plucked a branch to send lineendhere to the north country . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i put on my dress of lineendhere apricot -- yellow silk and bound up my hair lineendhere black as the crow’s wing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but which is the road lineendhere that leads to the western lineendhere island? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i’ll ask the man at lineendhere the ferry by the lineendhere bridge of boats . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the sun is sinking and the lineendhere orioles flying home: and the wind is blowing lineendhere and sighing in the walnut -- tree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i’ll stand under the tree just lineendhere beside the gate: i’ll stand by the door lineendhere and show off my enamelled hair -- pins . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” she’s opened the gate , but lineendhere her lover has not come: she’s gone out lineendhere at the gate to pluck red lotus . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as she plucks the lotus on the lineendhere southern dyke in autumn , the lotus flowers lineendhere stand higher than a man’s head . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she bends down -- and plays with lineendhere the lotus seeds , the lotus lineendhere seeds are green like the lake -- water . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she gathers the flowers and lineendhere puts them into her gown -- the lotus -- bud lineendhere that is red all through . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she thinks of her lover , her lover lineendhere that does not come: she looks up and sees the wild geese flying -- lineendhere the western island is full of wild geese . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to look for her lineendhere lover she climbs lineendhere the blue tower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the tower is high: she lineendhere looks , but cannot see: all day she leans lineendhere on the balcony rails . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the rail is lineendhere twisted into lineendhere a twelve -- fold pattern . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she lets fall her lineendhere hand white like the colour lineendhere of jade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she rolls up the awning , lineendhere she sees the wide sky , and the sea -- water lineendhere waving its vacant blue . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “the sea shall carry my dreams far lineendhere away , so that you shall be sorry lineendhere at last for my sorrow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if the south wind -- only knew my lineendhere thoughts it would blow my dreams till they got lineendhere to the western island . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” i was brought up under lineendhere the stone castle: my window opened lineendhere on to the castle tower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the castle were lineendhere beautiful young men who waved to me as lineendhere they went in and out . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere chiang -- nan is a glorious lineendhere and beautiful land , and chin -- ling an lineendhere exalted and kingly province ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the green canals of the city lineendhere stretch on and on and its high towers lineendhere stretch up and up . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere flying gables lean over lineendhere the bridle -- road: drooping willows cover lineendhere the royal aqueduct . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shrill flutes sing by the coach’s lineendhere awning , and reiterated lineendhere drums bang near its painted wheels . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the names of the lineendhere deserving shall be carved lineendhere on the cloud terrace . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and for those who lineendhere have done valiantly lineendhere rich reward awaits . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now late i follow time’s lineendhere necessity: mounting a barricade lineendhere i pacify remote tribes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere discarding my sash i don a lineendhere coat of rhinoceros -- skin: rolling up my lineendhere skirts i shoulder a black bow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere even at the very lineendhere start my strength fails: what will become of me lineendhere before it’s all over? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere red hills lie athwart us lineendhere as a menace in the west , and fiery lineendhere mountains glare terrible in the south . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the body burns , the lineendhere head aches and throbs: if a bird light here , its lineendhere soul forthwith departs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere warm springs pour from lineendhere cloudy pools and hot smoke issues lineendhere between the rocks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sun and moon are lineendhere perpetually obscured: the lineendhere rain and dew never stay dry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there are red serpents lineendhere a hundred feet long , and black snakes lineendhere ten girths round . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sand -- spitters shoot their poison at lineendhere the sunbeams: the flying insects are lineendhere ill with the shifting glare . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the hungry monkeys dare not lineendhere come down to eat: the morning birds lineendhere dare not set out to fly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the ching river many die lineendhere of poison: crossing the lu one is lucky lineendhere if one is only ill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our living feet lineendhere walk on dead ground: our high lineendhere wills surmount the snares of fate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the spear -- boat general lineendhere got but little honour: the lineendhere wave -- subduer met with scant reward . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if our prince still grudges the things lineendhere that are easy to give , can he hope that his lineendhere soldiers will give what is hardest to give? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “i heard at night your lineendhere long sighs and knew that you lineendhere were thinking of me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” as she spoke , the doors of heaven lineendhere opened and our souls conversed lineendhere and i saw her face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she set me a lineendhere pillow to rest on and lineendhere she brought me meat and drink . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i stood beside her where she lay , but suddenly lineendhere woke and she was not there: and none knew how my soul was torn , how lineendhere the tears fell surging over my breast . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the high trees -- many doleful lineendhere winds: the ocean waters -- lashed lineendhere into waves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if the sharp sword be not lineendhere in your hand , how can you hope your friends lineendhere will remain many? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do you not lineendhere see that sparrow lineendhere on the fence? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere seeing the hawk lineendhere it casts itself lineendhere into the snare . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the fowler to catch the lineendhere sparrow is delighted: the young man to lineendhere see the sparrow is grieved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he takes his sword and lineendhere cuts through the netting: the yellow sparrow lineendhere flies away , away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere away , away , up lineendhere to the blue sky and down again lineendhere to thank the young man . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a beautiful place lineendhere is the town of lo -- yang: the big streets lineendhere are full of spring light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lads go driving out with harps lineendhere in their hands: the mulberry girls go out lineendhere to the fields with their baskets . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere golden whips lineendhere glint at the lineendhere horses’ flanks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gauze sleeves lineendhere brush the green lineendhere boughs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere racing dawn , the carriages lineendhere come home , -- and the girls with their high baskets lineendhere full of fruit . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my bed is so empty that lineendhere i keep on waking up: as the cold increases , lineendhere the night -- wind begins to blow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it rustles the curtains , making lineendhere a noise like the sea: oh that those were waves lineendhere which could carry me back to you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere entering the hall , she lineendhere meets the new wife: leaving the gate , she runs lineendhere into her former husband . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere words stick: she does not manage to lineendhere say anything: she presses her hands lineendhere together and hesitates . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere agitates moon -- like fan -- sheds pearl -- like tears -- realizes lineendhere she loves him just as much as ever: that her present lineendhere pain will never come to an end . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who says that it’s by my lineendhere desire , this separation , lineendhere this living so far from you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my dress still smells of the lineendhere lavender you gave: my hand still holds lineendhere the letter that you sent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere round my waist i wear lineendhere a double sash: i dream that it binds us lineendhere both with a same -- heart knot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere did not you know that people lineendhere hide their love , like a flower that seems too lineendhere precious to be picked? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of marsh -- mallows my lineendhere boat is made , the lineendhere ropes are lily -- roots . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the pole -- star is lineendhere athwart the sky: the lineendhere moon sinks low . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it’s at lineendhere the ferry i’m plucking lineendhere lilies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but it might be the yellow river -- lineendhere so afraid you seem of the wind and waves , so long lineendhere you tarry at the crossing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the road that i came by mounts lineendhere eight thousand feet: the river that i lineendhere crossed hangs a hundred fathoms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the brambles lineendhere so thick that in summer lineendhere one cannot pass ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the snow so lineendhere high that in winter lineendhere one cannot climb ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with branches that interlace lineendhere lung valley is dark: against cliffs that tower lineendhere one’s voice beats and echoes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i turn my head , and it lineendhere seems only a dream that i ever lineendhere lived in the streets of hsien -- yang . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the evening river is level lineendhere and motionless -- the spring colours lineendhere just open to their full . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly a wave carries lineendhere the moon away and the tidal water lineendhere comes with its freight of stars . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere kao huan , that lineendhere son of a mouse dared lineendhere to attack king pi . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but at the first stroke of sword lineendhere and bow , the aggressor’s plot lineendhere recoiled on himself . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tchirek river lies under the lineendhere dark mountains: where the sky is like the sides of a lineendhere tent stretched down over the great steppe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sky is gray , gray: and the lineendhere steppe wide , wide: over grass that the wind has battered lineendhere low sheep and oxen roam . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere business men boast of their skill lineendhere and cunning but in philosophy they lineendhere are like little children . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bragging to each other of successful lineendhere depredations they neglect to consider the lineendhere ultimate fate of the body . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “tell me now , what should a lineendhere man want but to sit alone , sipping lineendhere his cup of wine? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then i could jog through a lineendhere happy five -- score years and , at the lineendhere end , need no paradise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these days , continually lineendhere fuddled with drink , i fail to satisfy lineendhere the appetites of the soul . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but seeing men all lineendhere behaving like drunkards , how can i lineendhere alone remain sober? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “his subjects were always original , lineendhere but his poems are seldom worth quoting ,” is lineendhere a chinese opinion of him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i loved you dearly , lineendhere stone fish lake , with your rock -- island shaped lineendhere like a swimming fish ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the fish’s back is lineendhere the wine -- cup hollow and round the fish , -- the flowing lineendhere waters of the lake . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the boys on the shore sent little lineendhere wooden ships , each made to carry a lineendhere single cup of wine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the island -- drinkers emptied lineendhere the liquor -- boats and set their sails and lineendhere sent them back for more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the shores of the lake were lineendhere jutting slabs of rock and under the rocks lineendhere there flowed an icy stream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere heated with wine , to rinse lineendhere our mouths and hands in those cold waters lineendhere was a joy beyond compare ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of gold and jewels i lineendhere have not any need; for caps and lineendhere coaches i do not care at all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but i wish i could sit on the lineendhere rocky banks of the lake for ever and ever lineendhere staring at the stone fish . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above the lake are deep lineendhere mountain valleys , and men dwelling lineendhere whose hearts are without guile . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gay like children , they swarm lineendhere to the tops of the trees; and run to lineendhere the water to catch bream and trout . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their pleasures are the same as lineendhere those of beasts and birds; they put no restraint lineendhere either on body or mind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere far i have wandered throughout lineendhere the nine lands; wherever i went such lineendhere manners had disappeared . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i find myself standing and lineendhere wondering , perplexed , whether saints and sages lineendhere have really done us good . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the hills and rivers lineendhere of the lowland country you lineendhere have made your battle -- ground . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how do you suppose lineendhere the people who live there will lineendhere procure “firewood and hay”? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do not let me hear you talking together lineendhere about titles and promotions; for a single general’s lineendhere reputation is made out of ten thousand corpses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere families , when a lineendhere child is born want it to lineendhere be intelligent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i , through intelligence , having lineendhere wrecked my whole life , only hope the baby will lineendhere prove ignorant and stupid . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then he will crown a tranquil lineendhere life by becoming a cabinet lineendhere minister . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an old man selling lineendhere charms in a cranny of lineendhere the town wall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he writes out spells lineendhere to bless the silkworms and spells lineendhere to protect the corn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with the money he lineendhere gets each day he only lineendhere buys wine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but he does not worry lineendhere when his legs get wobbly , for he lineendhere has a boy to lean on . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere away and away lineendhere i sail in my light boat; my heart leaps with lineendhere a great gust of joy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through the leafless branches i lineendhere see the temple in the wood; over the dwindling lineendhere stream the stone bridge towers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere down the grassy lanes sheep lineendhere and oxen pass; in the misty lineendhere village cranes and magpies cry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere back in my home i drink lineendhere a cup of wine and need not fear lineendhere the greed of the evening wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the southern village lineendhere the boy who minds the ox with his naked lineendhere feet stands on the ox’s back . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere through the hole in his coat lineendhere the river wind blows; through his broken lineendhere hat the mountain rain pours . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the long dyke he seemed to lineendhere be far away; in the narrow lane lineendhere suddenly we were face to face . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the boy is home and the lineendhere ox is back in its stall; and a dark smoke lineendhere oozes through the thatched roof . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of spring water , -- thirty lineendhere or forty miles: in the lineendhere evening sunlight , -- three or four houses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere youths and boys minding lineendhere geese and ducks: women and girls tending lineendhere mulberries and hemp . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the place , -- remote: their coats lineendhere and scarves old: the year , -- fruitful: their lineendhere talk and laughter gay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old wanderer moors lineendhere his flat boat and staggers up the bank to lineendhere pluck wistaria flowers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the little cart lineendhere jolting and banging through the lineendhere yellow haze of dusk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the man pushing lineendhere behind: the woman lineendhere pulling in front . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they have left the city lineendhere and do not know where lineendhere to go . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “green , green , those elm -- tree leaves: _they_ will cure lineendhere my hunger , if only we could find some quiet lineendhere place and sup on them together . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” the wind has flattened the yellow lineendhere mother -- wort: above it in the distance they lineendhere see the walls of a house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “_there_ surely must be lineendhere people living who’ll give you lineendhere something to eat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” they tap at the door , but lineendhere no one comes: they look in , but lineendhere the kitchen is empty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they stand hesitating lineendhere in the lonely road and their lineendhere tears fall like rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere since i left my home lineendhere to seek official state seven lineendhere years i have lived in ch’ang -- an . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineendhere have i lineendhere gained? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we have roamed on horseback under lineendhere the flowering trees; we have walked in the snow lineendhere and warmed our hearts with wine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we have met and parted at lineendhere the western gate and neither of us lineendhere bothered to put on cap or belt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we did not go up together lineendhere for examination; we were not serving in lineendhere the same department of state . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the bond that joined us lineendhere lay deeper than outward things; the rivers lineendhere of our souls spring from the same well ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i look down on lineendhere the twelve city streets: -- red dust lineendhere flanked by green trees ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere coaches and horsemen alone lineendhere fill my eyes; i do not see whom my lineendhere heart longs to see . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of all that walk on lineendhere the north -- south road there is not one that i care lineendhere for more than the rest ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the palace doors the smell of lineendhere meat and wine; on the road the bones of lineendhere one who was frozen to death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ten leagues riding , always lineendhere facing to the north; the cold wind lineendhere almost blew off my ears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i waited for the bell outside lineendhere the five gates; i waited for the summons lineendhere within the triple hall . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my hair and beard were frozen lineendhere and covered with icicles; my coat lineendhere and robe -- chilly like water . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the western window i lineendhere paused from writing rescripts; the pines and bamboos lineendhere were all buried in stillness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the moon rose and a lineendhere calm wind came; suddenly , it was like lineendhere an evening in the hills . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and so , as i dozed , i dreamed lineendhere of the south west and thought i was staying lineendhere at the hsien -- yu temple . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i woke and heard the dripping lineendhere of the palace clock i still thought it the lineendhere murmur of a mountain stream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the snow has lineendhere gone from chung -- nan; spring is lineendhere almost come . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lovely in the distance lineendhere its blue colours , against the lineendhere brown of the streets . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a thousand coaches , ten thousand lineendhere horsemen pass down the nine roads; turns his head lineendhere and looks at the mountains , -- not one man ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we talked together lineendhere in the yung -- shou temple; we parted to the lineendhere north of the hsin -- ch’ang dyke . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere going home -- i shed a lineendhere few tears , grieving about lineendhere things , -- not sorry for you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere long , long the road to lineendhere lan -- t’ien; you said yourself you would lineendhere not be able to write . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere reckoning up your halts lineendhere for eating and sleeping -- by this time lineendhere you’ve crossed the shang mountains . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere last night the clouds scattered lineendhere away; a thousand leagues , the lineendhere same moonlight scene . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when dawn came , i dreamt i saw lineendhere your face; it must have been that you lineendhere were thinking of me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in my dream , i thought i lineendhere held your hand and asked you to tell lineendhere me what your thoughts were . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and _you_ said: “i miss you lineendhere bitterly , but there’s no one here to lineendhere send to you with a letter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” when i awoke , before lineendhere i had time to speak , a knocking on lineendhere the door sounded “doong , doong ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” they came and told me a lineendhere messenger from shang -- chou had brought a lineendhere letter , -- a single scroll from you ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere up from my pillow i lineendhere suddenly sprang out of bed , and lineendhere threw you my clothes , all topsy -- turvy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i undid the knot and lineendhere saw the letter within; a single sheet lineendhere with thirteen lines of writing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the top it told the sorrows lineendhere of an exile’s heart; at the bottom it described lineendhere the pains of separation . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sorrows and pains took lineendhere up so much space there was no room left lineendhere to talk about the weather ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but you said that when you wrote you were staying for the lineendhere night to the east of shang -- chou; sitting alone , lighted by a solitary lineendhere candle lodging in the mountain hostel of yang -- ch’ēng . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere night was late when you lineendhere finished writing , the mountain moon lineendhere was slanting towards the west . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what is it lineendhere lies aslant across lineendhere the moon? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a single tree of purple _paulovnia_ flowers -- lineendhere paulovnia flowers just on the point of falling are a lineendhere symbol to express “thinking of an absent friend . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” lovingly -- you wrote on the back lineendhere side , to send in the letter , your “poem of lineendhere the paulovnia flower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” the poem of the paulovnia lineendhere flower has eight rhymes; yet these eight couplets have lineendhere cast a spell on my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they have taken hold of this lineendhere morning’s thoughts and carried them to yours , the lineendhere night you wrote your letter . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the whole poem lineendhere i read three times; each verse ten lineendhere times i recite . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so precious to me are the lineendhere fourscore words that each letter changes lineendhere into a bar of gold ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the yellow bird’s note was almost stopped; and half lineendhere formed the green plum’s fruit; sitting and grieving that spring things were over , lineendhere i rose and entered the eastern garden’s gate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i carried my cup and was lineendhere dully drinking alone: suddenly i lineendhere heard a knocking sound at the door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dwelling secluded , i was lineendhere glad that someone had come; how much the more , lineendhere when i saw it was ch’ēn hsiung ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at ease and leisure , -- all day lineendhere we talked; crowding and jostling , -- the lineendhere feelings of many years . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how great a lineendhere thing is a single lineendhere cup of wine ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for it makes us lineendhere tell the story of lineendhere our whole lives . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i was almost forty lineendhere i had a daughter whose name lineendhere was golden bells . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now it is just a year since lineendhere she was born; she is learning to lineendhere sit and cannot yet talk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ashamed , -- to find that i have lineendhere not a sage’s heart: i cannot resist lineendhere vulgar thoughts and feelings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere henceforward i am lineendhere tied to things outside myself: my only reward , -- the lineendhere pleasure i am getting now . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if i am spared the grief of lineendhere her dying young , then i shall have the lineendhere trouble of getting her married . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my plan for retiring lineendhere and going back to the hills must now lineendhere be postponed for fifteen years ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ruined and ill , -- a man lineendhere of two score; pretty and guileless , -- a lineendhere girl of three . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not a boy , -- but , still better lineendhere than nothing: to soothe one’s feeling , -- from lineendhere time to time a kiss ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there came a day , -- they suddenly lineendhere took her from me; her soul’s shadow lineendhere wandered i know not where . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at last , by thinking of the time lineendhere before she was born , by thought and reason lineendhere i drove the pain away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere since my heart forgot her , many lineendhere days have passed and three times winter lineendhere has changed to spring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this morning , for a little , lineendhere the old grief came back , because , in the lineendhere road , i met her foster -- nurse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sad , sad -- lean with long illness; lineendhere monotonous , monotonous -- days lineendhere and nights pass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the summer trees have clad lineendhere themselves in shade; the autumn “lan” already lineendhere houses the dew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the eggs that lay in the lineendhere nest when i took to bed have changed into little lineendhere birds and flown away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the worm that then lay hidden lineendhere in its hole has hatched into a cricket lineendhere sitting on the tree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the four seasons go on for lineendhere ever and ever: in all nature nothing stops lineendhere to rest even for a moment . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only the sick lineendhere man’s heart deep down still aches lineendhere as of old ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere deep the waters of the black pool , lineendhere coloured like ink; they say a holy dragon lineendhere lives there , whom men have never seen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere beside the pool they have built a shrine; the authorities lineendhere have established a ritual; a dragon by itself remains lineendhere a dragon , but men can make it a god . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere prosperity and disaster , rain and drought , lineendhere plagues and pestilences -- by the village people were all lineendhere regarded as the sacred dragon’s doing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they all made offerings of sucking -- pig and poured lineendhere libations of wine; the morning prayers and evening gifts lineendhere depended on a “medium’s” advice when the dragon comes , ah ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wind stirs lineendhere and sighs paper lineendhere money thrown , ah ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere silk lineendhere umbrellas lineendhere waved . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the lineendhere dragon goes , lineendhere ah ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere wind lineendhere also -- still . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the cups lineendhere and vessels lineendhere are cold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere meats lie stacked on the rocks lineendhere of the pool’s shore; wine flows on the grass lineendhere in front of the shrine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i do not know , of all those offerings , lineendhere how much the dragon eats; but the mice of the woods and the foxes lineendhere of the hills are continually drunk and sated . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why are lineendhere the foxes lineendhere so lucky? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what have the sucking -- pigs done , lineendhere that year by year _they_ should be killed , lineendhere merely to glut the foxes? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that the foxes are robbing the sacred lineendhere dragon and eating his sucking -- pig , beneath the nine -- fold depths lineendhere of his pool , does he know or not? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there came an officer lineendhere knocking by night at my door -- in a lineendhere loud voice demanding grain -- tribute . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my house -- servants dared not wait till lineendhere the morning , but brought candles lineendhere and set them on the barn -- floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere passed through the sieve , lineendhere clean -- washed as pearls , a whole cart -- load , thirty lineendhere bushels of grain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but still they cry that it is lineendhere not paid in full: with whips and curses lineendhere they goad my servants and boys . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once , in error , i entered lineendhere public life; i am inwardly ashamed lineendhere that my talents were not sufficient . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in succession i lineendhere occupied four official posts; for lineendhere doing nothing , -- ten years’ salary ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere often have i heard that lineendhere saying of ancient men that “good and ill lineendhere follow in an endless chain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” and to -- day it ought to set lineendhere my heart at rest to return to others lineendhere the corn in my great barn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the land of tao -- chou many lineendhere of the people are dwarfs; the tallest of them lineendhere never grow to more than three feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they were sold in the market as dwarf lineendhere slaves and yearly sent to court; described as “an offering lineendhere of natural products from the land of tao -- chou . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” a strange “offering of natural products”; lineendhere i never heard of one yet that parted men from lineendhere those they loved , never to meet again ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere old men -- weeping for their lineendhere grandsons; mothers for lineendhere their children ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one day -- yang ch’ēng came to govern lineendhere the land; he refused to send up dwarf slaves lineendhere in spite of incessant mandates . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” the emperor’s heart was deeply lineendhere moved and he sealed and sent a scroll “the yearly tribute lineendhere of dwarfish slaves is henceforth annulled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” the people of lineendhere tao -- chou , old ones and young ones , lineendhere how great their joy ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere father with son and brother with lineendhere brother henceforward kept together; from that day lineendhere for ever more they lived as free men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the people lineendhere of tao -- chou still enjoy lineendhere this gift . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and even now when lineendhere they speak of the governor lineendhere tears start to their eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and lest their children and their children’s children lineendhere should forget the governor’s name , when boys are born the lineendhere syllable “yang” is often used in their forename . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of cord and cassia -- wood lineendhere is the harp compounded: within it lineendhere lie ancient melodies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ancient melodies -- weak and lineendhere savourless , not appealing lineendhere to present men’s taste . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere light and colour are lineendhere faded from the jade stops: dust has lineendhere covered the rose -- red strings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere decay and ruin came lineendhere to it long ago , but the sound that lineendhere is left is still cold and clear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i do not refuse to play lineendhere it , if you want me to: but even if lineendhere i play , people will not listen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how did it come lineendhere to be neglected lineendhere so? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere because of lineendhere the ch’iang flute and the lineendhere ch’in flageolet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the singers have hushed their lineendhere notes of clear song: the red sleeves of the lineendhere dancers are motionless . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hugging his lute , the old lineendhere harper of chao rocks and sways as he lineendhere touches the five chords . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the loud notes swell and lineendhere scatter abroad: “sa , sa ,” like lineendhere wind blowing the rain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the soft notes dying lineendhere almost to nothing: “ch’ieh , ch’ieh ,” like the lineendhere voice of ghosts talking . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now as glad as the magpie’s lineendhere lucky song: again bitter as the lineendhere gibbon’s ominous cry . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and those who sit and listen lineendhere to the tune he plays of soul and body lineendhere lose the mastery . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and those who pass that way as lineendhere he plays the tune , suddenly stop lineendhere and cannot raise their feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alas , alas that the lineendhere ears of common men should love the lineendhere modern and not love the old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thus it is that the harp in lineendhere the green window day by day is lineendhere covered deeper with dust . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the royal city lineendhere spring is almost over: tinkle , tinkle -- the lineendhere coaches and horsemen pass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we tell each other “this is the lineendhere peony season”: and follow with the lineendhere crowd that goes to the flower market . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “cheap and dear -- no uniform price: lineendhere the cost of the plant depends on the lineendhere number of blossoms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for the fine flower , -- a hundred lineendhere pieces of damask: for the cheap lineendhere flower , -- five bits of silk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere above is spread an awning lineendhere to protect them: around is woven a lineendhere wattle -- fence to screen them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if you sprinkle water and lineendhere cover the roots with mud , when they are transplanted , lineendhere they will not lose their beauty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” each household thoughtlessly lineendhere follows the custom , man by man , no lineendhere one realizing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there happened to be lineendhere an old farm labourer who lineendhere came by chance that way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he bowed his head and sighed lineendhere a deep sigh: but this sigh lineendhere nobody understood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he was thinking , “a cluster lineendhere of deep -- red flowers would pay the taxes of lineendhere ten poor houses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” tartars lineendhere led in chains , tartars lineendhere led in chains ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their ears pierced , their lineendhere faces bruised -- they are driven lineendhere into the land of ch’in . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the son of heaven lineendhere took pity on them and would not lineendhere have them slain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a petty officer in a yellow coat lineendhere took down their names and surnames: they were led from the city lineendhere of ch’ang -- an under escort of an armed guard . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their bodies were covered lineendhere with the wounds of arrows , their lineendhere bones stood out from their cheeks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they had grown so lineendhere weak they could only march lineendhere a single stage a day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the morning they must satisfy hunger lineendhere and thirst with neither plate nor cup: at night they must lie in lineendhere their dirt and rags on beds that stank with filth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly they came to the lineendhere yangtze river and remembered the lineendhere waters of chiao . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with lowered hands lineendhere and levelled voices they sobbed lineendhere a muffled song . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then one tartar lifted up his lineendhere voice and spoke to the other tartars , “_your_ sorrows are none lineendhere at all compared with _my_ sorrows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” those that were with him in the same lineendhere band asked to hear his tale: as he tried to speak lineendhere the words were choked by anger . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he told them lineendhere “i was born and bred in the town lineendhere of liang -- yüan . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the frontier wars lineendhere of ta -- li i fell into lineendhere the tartars’ hands . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere since the days the tartars took me alive lineendhere forty years have passed: they put me into a coat lineendhere of skins tied with a belt of rope . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only on the first lineendhere of the first month might i wear lineendhere my chinese dress . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as i put on my lineendhere coat and arranged my cap , lineendhere how fast the tears flowed ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i made in my heart a secret vow i lineendhere would find a way home: i hid my plan from my tartar wife lineendhere and the children she had borne me in the land . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i thought to myself , ‘it is well for me that lineendhere my limbs are still strong ,’ and yet , being old , in my heart i lineendhere feared i should never live to return . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the tartar chieftains shoot so well that the lineendhere birds are afraid to fly: from the risk of their arrows i lineendhere escaped alive and fled swiftly home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hiding all day and walking all night , lineendhere i crossed the great desert: where clouds are dark and the moon lineendhere black and the sands eddy in the wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but the moving horsemen did not hear lineendhere that i spoke the han tongue: their captain took me for lineendhere a tartar born and had me bound in chains . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are sending me away to the south -- east , lineendhere to a low and swampy land: no one now will take pity lineendhere on me: resistance is all in vain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thinking of this , my voice chokes and i lineendhere ask of heaven above , was i spared from death only lineendhere to spend the rest of my years in sorrow? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my native village of liang -- yüan i lineendhere shall not see again: my wife and children in the tartars’ lineendhere land i have fruitlessly deserted . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i fell among tartars and was taken prisoner , lineendhere i pined for the land of han: now that i am back in the land lineendhere of han , they have turned me into a tartar . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere had i but known what lineendhere my fate would be , i would not lineendhere have started home ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for the two lands , so lineendhere wide apart , are alike in lineendhere the sorrow they bring . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tartar lineendhere prisoners lineendhere in chains ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of all the sorrows lineendhere of all the prisoners mine lineendhere is the hardest to bear ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere never in the world has so great a wrong lineendhere befallen the lot of man , -- a han heart and a han lineendhere tongue set in the body of a turk . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” a lineendhere government -- bull yoked to lineendhere a government -- cart ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere moored by the bank lineendhere of ch’an river , a barge lineendhere loaded with gravel . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a single load lineendhere of gravel , how many lineendhere pounds it weighs ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere carrying at lineendhere dawn , carrying at dusk , what lineendhere is it all for? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are carrying lineendhere it towards the five gates , to lineendhere the west of the main road . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere under the shadow lineendhere of green laurels they are lineendhere making a gravel -- drive . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for yesterday arrove , newly appointed , the lineendhere assistant chancellor of the realm , and was terribly afraid lineendhere that the wet and mud would dirty his horse’s hoofs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the chancellor’s horse’s hoofs stepped on the lineendhere gravel and remained perfectly clean; but the bull employed lineendhere in dragging the cart was almost sweating blood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the assistant chancellor’s lineendhere business is to “save men , govern the country lineendhere and harmonize yin and yang . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” whether the bull’s neck lineendhere is sore need not trouble lineendhere him at all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there was once a man who dreamt lineendhere he went to heaven: his dream -- body lineendhere soared aloft through space . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he rode on the back of lineendhere a white -- plumed crane , and was led on his flight lineendhere by two crimson banners . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whirring of wings lineendhere and flapping of lineendhere coat tails ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere jade bells lineendhere suddenly lineendhere all a -- tinkle ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere half way to heaven , he lineendhere looked down beneath him , down on the dark lineendhere turmoil of the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gradually he lineendhere lost the place of his native town; mountains lineendhere and water -- nothing else distinct . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the eastern ocean -- a single lineendhere strip of white: the hills of china , -- five lineendhere specks of green . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gliding past him a host of fairies lineendhere swept in long procession to the palace lineendhere of the jade city . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they take him to the presence of lineendhere the mighty jade emperor: he bows his lineendhere head and proffers loyal homage . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the emperor says: “we see lineendhere you have fairy talents: be of good lineendhere heart and do not slight yourself . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we shall send to fetch you in lineendhere fifteen years and give you a place in the lineendhere courtyard of immortality . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” twice bowing , he acknowledged lineendhere the gracious words: then woke from sleep , full lineendhere of wonder and joy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he hid his secret and dared lineendhere not tell it abroad: but vowed a vow lineendhere he would live in a cave of rock . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere from love and affection he severed lineendhere kith and kin: from his eating and drinking he lineendhere omitted savoury and spice . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his morning meal was a lineendhere dish of coral -- dust: at night he sipped an lineendhere essence of dewy mists . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the empty mountains he lineendhere lived for thirty years daily watching for lineendhere the heavenly coach to come . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the time of appointment lineendhere was already long past , but lineendhere of wings and coach -- bells -- still no sound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his teeth and hair daily withered lineendhere and decayed: his ears and eyes gradually lineendhere lost their keenness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one morning he suffered the common lineendhere change and his body was one with the lineendhere dust and dirt of the hill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gods lineendhere and lineendhere fairies ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if indeed such things there lineendhere be , their ways are beyond the lineendhere striving of mortal men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” though you sweat and lineendhere toil , what shall your lineendhere trouble bring? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you will only lineendhere shorten the five -- score lineendhere years of your span . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sad , alas , the lineendhere man who dreamt of lineendhere fairies ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for a single lineendhere dream spoiled his lineendhere whole life . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere boundless , lineendhere the great lineendhere sea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere straight down , -- no lineendhere bottom: sideways , -- no lineendhere border . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of cloudy waves and misty billows lineendhere down in the uttermost depths men have fabled , lineendhere in the midst there stand three sacred hills . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the lineendhere hills , thick growing , -- herbs that banish lineendhere death . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wings grow on those who lineendhere eat them and they turn into lineendhere heavenly “hsien . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” the lord of ch’in and wu of han lineendhere believed in these stories: and magic -- workers year by lineendhere year were sent to gather the herbs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the blessed islands , lineendhere now and of old , what lineendhere but an empty tale? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the misty waters lineendhere spread before them and they knew lineendhere not where to seek . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere dauntless , lineendhere the mighty lineendhere wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their eyes search but lineendhere cannot see the shores of lineendhere the blessed islands . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they cannot find the blessed isles and yet lineendhere they dare not return: youths and maidens that began lineendhere the quest grew grey on board the boat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do you not see the graves lineendhere on the top of black horse hill lineendhere and the tombs at mo -- ling? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what is left but the lineendhere sighing wind blowing in the lineendhere tangled grasses? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the two red towers lineendhere north and south rise facing lineendhere each other . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i beg to lineendhere ask , to whom do lineendhere they belong? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the two princes blew on their flutes and lineendhere drew down fairies from the sky , who carried them off through the lineendhere five clouds , soaring away to heaven . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere their halls and houses , that they lineendhere could not take with them , were turned into temples lineendhere planted in the dust of the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the tiring -- rooms and dancers’ towers all lineendhere is silent and still; only the willows like dancers’ lineendhere arms , and the pond like a mirror . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the flowers are falling at yellow lineendhere twilight , when things are sad and hushed , one does not hear lineendhere songs and flutes , but only chimes and bells . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the imperial patent on the lineendhere temple doors is written in letters of gold; for nuns’ quarters lineendhere and monks’ cells ample space is allowed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for green moss and bright moonlight -- plenty of room lineendhere provided; in a hovel opposite is a sick lineendhere man who has hardly room to lie down . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i remember once when at p’ing -- yang they were lineendhere building a great man’s house how it swallowed up the housing lineendhere space of thousands of ordinary men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the immortals are leaving us , two lineendhere by two , and their houses are turned into temples; i begin to lineendhere fear that the whole world will become a vast convent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere an old charcoal -- seller cutting wood lineendhere and burning charcoal in the forests lineendhere of the southern mountain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his face , stained with dust lineendhere and ashes , has turned to lineendhere the colour of smoke . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the hair on his temples lineendhere is streaked with gray: his ten lineendhere fingers are black . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the money he gets lineendhere by selling charcoal , how lineendhere far does it go? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is just enough lineendhere to clothe his limbs and put food lineendhere in his mouth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere although , alas , the lineendhere coat on his back is a coat lineendhere without lining . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he hopes for the coming lineendhere of cold weather , to send up lineendhere the price of coal ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere last night , outside the city , -- a whole lineendhere foot of snow; at dawn he drives the charcoal lineendhere wagon along the frozen ruts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oxen , -- weary; man , -- hungry: the sun , already lineendhere high; outside the gate , to the south of the market , lineendhere at last they stop in the mud . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly , lineendhere a pair of prancing lineendhere horsemen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who lineendhere can it be lineendhere coming? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a public official lineendhere in a yellow coat and a lineendhere boy in a white shirt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in their hands they hold a written warrant: lineendhere on their tongues -- the words of an order; they turn back the wagon and curse lineendhere the oxen , leading them off to the north . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a whole wagon lineendhere of charcoal , more than lineendhere a thousand pieces ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if officials choose lineendhere to take it away , the woodman lineendhere may not complain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere half a piece of red silk and a single yard lineendhere of damask , the courtiers have tied to the oxen’s collar , lineendhere as the price of a wagon of coal ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i was going to the city to lineendhere sell the herbs i had plucked; on the way i rested lineendhere by some trees at the blue gate . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere along the road there came lineendhere a horseman riding; whose face was pale lineendhere with a strange look of dread . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere friends and relations , waiting lineendhere to say good -- bye , pressed at his side , but lineendhere he did not dare to pause . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i , in wonder , asked the lineendhere people about me who he was and lineendhere what had happened to him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they told me this was a lineendhere privy councillor whose grave duties were lineendhere like the pivot of state . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his food allowance was ten lineendhere thousand cash; three times a day the lineendhere emperor came to his house . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yesterday he was called to lineendhere a meeting of heroes: to -- day he is banished lineendhere to the country of yai -- chou . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so always , the counsellors lineendhere of kings; favour and ruin changed lineendhere between dawn and dusk ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere green , green , -- the grass of the eastern lineendhere suburb; and amid the grass , a lineendhere road that leads to the hills . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere resting in peace among the lineendhere white clouds , at last he has made lineendhere a “coup” that cannot fail ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at hsin -- fēng an old man -- four -- score and lineendhere eight; the hair on his head and the hair of lineendhere his eyebrows -- white as the new snow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere leaning on the shoulders of his great -- grandchildren , lineendhere he walks in front of the inn; with his left arm he leans lineendhere on their shoulders; his right arm is broken . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i asked the old man how many years lineendhere had passed since he broke his arm; i also asked the cause of the lineendhere injury , how and why it happened? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old man said he was born and reared lineendhere in the district of hsin -- fēng; at the time of his lineendhere birth -- a wise reign; no wars or discords . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “often i listened in the pear -- tree garden to lineendhere the sound of flute and song; naught i knew of banner and lineendhere lance; nothing of arrow or bow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then came the wars of t’ien -- pao lineendhere and the great levy of men; of three men lineendhere in each house , -- one man was taken . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and those to lineendhere whom the lot fell , where lineendhere were they taken to? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when the great army waded across , the lineendhere water seethed like a cauldron; when barely ten had entered lineendhere the water , two or three were dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to the north of my village , lineendhere to the south of my village the sound of lineendhere weeping and wailing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere children parting lineendhere from fathers and mothers; husbands lineendhere parting from wives . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere everyone says that in expeditions lineendhere against the min tribes of a million men who lineendhere are sent out , not one returns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i , that am old , was then lineendhere twenty -- four; my name and fore -- name were written down lineendhere in the rolls of the board of war . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the depth of the night not daring lineendhere to let any one know i secretly took a huge lineendhere stone and dashed it against my arm . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bones broken and sinews wounded lineendhere could not fail to hurt; i was ready enough to lineendhere bear pain , if only i got back home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my arm -- broken ever lineendhere since; it was sixty lineendhere years ago . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one limb , although lineendhere destroyed , -- whole body lineendhere safe ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but even now on winter lineendhere nights when the wind and rain blow from evening on till day’s lineendhere dawn i cannot sleep for pain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not sleeping for pain is a lineendhere small thing to bear , compared with the joy of being lineendhere alive when all the rest are dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for otherwise , years ago , at the ford lineendhere of lu river my body would have died and my soul lineendhere hovered by the bones that no one gathered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over the graves of lineendhere ten thousand soldiers , mournfully lineendhere hovering . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” so lineendhere the old man lineendhere spoke . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and i bid you listen to his words have you not lineendhere heard that the prime minister of k’ai -- yüan , sung k’ai -- fu , did not reward frontier exploits , lineendhere lest a spirit of aggression should prevail? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and have you not heard that the prime minister lineendhere of t’ien -- pao , yang kuo -- chung desiring to win imperial lineendhere favour , started a frontier war? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but long before he could win the lineendhere war , people had lost their temper; ask the man with lineendhere the broken arm in the village of hsin -- fēng? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere white billows and huge waves block the river lineendhere crossing; wherever i go , danger and difficulty; lineendhere whatever i do , failure . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere just as in my worldly career i lineendhere wander and lose the road , so when i come to the river lineendhere crossing , i am stopped by contrary winds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of fishes and prawns sodden in the rain lineendhere the smell fills my nostrils; with the stings of insects that lineendhere come with the fog , my whole body is sore . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am growing lineendhere old , time flies , and my short lineendhere span runs out . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while i sit in lineendhere a boat at chiu -- k’ou , lineendhere wasting ten days ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i take your poems in my hand and lineendhere read them beside the candle; the poems are finished: lineendhere the candle is low: dawn not yet come . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with sore eyes by the guttering candle lineendhere still i sit in the dark , listening to waves that , driven lineendhere by the wind , strike the prow of the ship . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have still to travel in my solitary lineendhere boat three or four leagues -- by misty waters and rainy lineendhere sands , while the yellow dusk thickens . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the forest trees are leafless and withered , -- after lineendhere the mountain rain; the roofs of the houses are hidden lineendhere low among the river mists . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the horses , fed on water grass , are lineendhere too weak to carry their load; the cottage walls of wattle lineendhere and thatch let the wind blow on one’s bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the distance i see red -- wheeled coaches lineendhere driving from the town -- gate; they have taken the trouble , these civil lineendhere people , to meet their new prefect ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there is no one among men that lineendhere has not a special failing: and my failing lineendhere consists in writing verses . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have broken away from lineendhere the thousand ties of life: but this lineendhere infirmity still remains behind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and often , when i have finished lineendhere a new poem , alone i climb the road lineendhere to the eastern rock . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i lean my body on the lineendhere banks of white stone: i pull down with my lineendhere hands a green cassia branch . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my mad singing startles lineendhere the valleys and hills: the apes and lineendhere birds all come to peep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fearing to become a lineendhere laughing -- stock to the world , i choose a place that is lineendhere unfrequented by men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at nine rivers , in the tenth year , lineendhere in winter , -- heavy snow; the river -- water covered with ice lineendhere and the forests broken with their load . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the birds of the air , hungry and lineendhere cold , went flying east and west; and with them flew a migrant lineendhere “yen ,” loudly clamouring for food . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere among the snow it pecked for grass; and rested lineendhere on the surface of the ice: it tried with its wings to scale lineendhere the sky; but its tired flight was slow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the boys of the river spread a net lineendhere and caught the bird as it flew; they took it in their hands lineendhere to the city -- market and sold it there alive . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i that was once a man of the lineendhere north am now an exile here: bird and man , in their lineendhere different kind , are each strangers in the south . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and because the sight of an exiled bird lineendhere wounded an exile’s heart , i paid your ransom and set lineendhere you free , and you flew away to the clouds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yen , yen , flying lineendhere to the clouds , tell me , whither lineendhere shall you go? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the official army and the rebel army lineendhere have grown old in their opposite trenches; the soldier’s rations lineendhere have grown so small , they’ll be glad of even you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the brave boys , in their hungry plight , will shoot lineendhere you and eat your flesh; they will pluck from your body those lineendhere long feathers and make them into arrow -- wings ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _you_, so bravely lineendhere splashing reds lineendhere and blues ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere just when _i_ lineendhere am getting wrinkled lineendhere and old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why should you waste the moments lineendhere of inspiration tracing the withered lineendhere limbs of a sick man? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tall , tall is the palace lineendhere of ch’i -- lin; but my deeds have not been lineendhere frescoed on its walls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere minutely limned on a lineendhere foot of painting silk -- what can i do lineendhere with a portrait such as _that_? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yesterday i heard lineendhere that such -- a -- one was gone; this morning they lineendhere tell me that so -- and -- so is dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of friends and acquaintances lineendhere more than two -- thirds have suffered change and lineendhere passed to the land of ghosts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere those that are gone i shall not lineendhere see again; they , alas , are for lineendhere ever finished and done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere those that are lineendhere left , -- where are lineendhere they now? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are all scattered , -- a lineendhere thousand miles lineendhere away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere those i have known and loved lineendhere through all my life , on the fingers of lineendhere my hand -- how many do i count? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere longing for each other we are lineendhere all grown gray; through the fleeting world rolled lineendhere like a wave in the stream . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alas that the feasts and lineendhere frolics of old days have withered and lineendhere vanished , bringing us to this ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when shall we meet and lineendhere drink a cup of wine and laughing gaze lineendhere into each other’s eyes? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere up and up , lineendhere the incense -- burner lineendhere peak ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in my heart lineendhere is stored what my eyes lineendhere and ears perceived . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all the year -- detained by lineendhere official business; to -- day at last lineendhere i got a chance to go . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grasping the creepers , i lineendhere clung to dangerous rocks; my hands lineendhere and feet -- weary with groping for hold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there came with me lineendhere three or four friends , but two friends dared lineendhere not go further . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at last we reached the topmost lineendhere crest of the peak; my eyes were blinded , lineendhere my soul rocked and reeled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the chasm beneath lineendhere me -- ten thousand feet; the ground i lineendhere stood on , only a foot wide . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if you have not exhausted the scope lineendhere of seeing and hearing , how can you realize lineendhere the wideness of the world? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the waters of the river lineendhere looked narrow as a ribbon , p’ēn castle lineendhere smaller than a man’s fist . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how it clings , lineendhere the dust of the world’s lineendhere halter ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it chokes my lineendhere limbs: i cannot lineendhere shake it away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thinking of retirement , lineendhere i heaved an envious sigh , then , with lowered lineendhere head , came back to the ants’ nest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my new province is a lineendhere land of bamboo -- groves: their shoots in spring lineendhere fill the valleys and hills . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the mountain woodman cuts an lineendhere armful of them and brings them down to lineendhere sell at the early market . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere things are cheap in proportion lineendhere as they are common; for two farthings , lineendhere i buy a whole bundle . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i put the shoots in a lineendhere great earthen pot and heat them up lineendhere along with boiling rice . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the purple nodules lineendhere broken , -- like an old brocade; the lineendhere white skin opened , -- like new pearls . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now every day lineendhere i eat them recklessly; for a lineendhere long time i have not touched meat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sent as a present lineendhere from annam -- a red lineendhere cockatoo . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere coloured like the peach -- tree lineendhere blossom , speaking with lineendhere the speech of men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and they did to it lineendhere what is always done to the lineendhere learned and eloquent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they took a lineendhere cage with stout bars and shut lineendhere it up inside . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere after lunch -- one short lineendhere nap: on waking up -- two lineendhere cups of tea . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere raising my head , i lineendhere see the sun’s light once again lineendhere slanting to the south -- west . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere those who are happy regret lineendhere the shortness of the day; those who are sad lineendhere tire of the year’s sloth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but those whose hearts are devoid lineendhere of joy or sadness just go on living , lineendhere regardless of “short” or “long . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” above , a mountain ten lineendhere thousand feet high: below , a river lineendhere a thousand fathoms deep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a strip of green , walled by lineendhere cliffs of stone: wide enough for the lineendhere passage of a single reed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere long before night the lineendhere walls are black with dusk; without lineendhere wind white waves rise . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the big rocks are like lineendhere a flat sword: the little rocks lineendhere resemble ivory tusks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we are stuck lineendhere fast and cannot lineendhere move a step . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how much the lineendhere less , three hundred lineendhere miles? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere frail and slender , the twisted -- bamboo lineendhere rope: weak , the dangerous hold lineendhere of the towers’ feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a single slip -- the whole lineendhere convoy lost: and _my_ life lineendhere hangs on _this_ thread ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have heard a saying “he that has lineendhere an upright heart shall walk scathless through lineendhere the lands of man and mo . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” how can i believe that lineendhere since the world began in every lineendhere shipwreck none have drowned but rogues? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and how can i , born lineendhere in evil days and fresh from failure , lineendhere ask a kindness of fate? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere often i fear that lineendhere these un -- talented limbs will be laid lineendhere at last in an un -- named grave ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly , suddenly , -- bearing lineendhere a stricken heart i left the gates , lineendhere with nothing to comfort me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere henceforward , -- relegated to deep seclusion in a bottomless lineendhere gorge , flanked by precipitous mountains , five months on end the passage of boats lineendhere is stopped by the piled billows that toss and leap like colts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the inhabitants of pa lineendhere resemble wild apes; fierce and lusty , lineendhere they fill the mountains and prairies . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere among such as these i cannot hope lineendhere for friends and am pleased with anyone who lineendhere is even remotely human ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i took money and bought lineendhere flowering trees and planted them out on lineendhere the bank to the east of the keep . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i simply bought whatever lineendhere had most blooms , not caring whether lineendhere peach , apricot , or plum . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a hundred fruits , all mixed lineendhere up together; a thousand branches , lineendhere flowering in due rotation . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere each has its season coming lineendhere early or late; but to all alike the lineendhere fertile soil is kind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the red flowers hang like lineendhere a heavy mist; the white flowers gleam lineendhere like a fall of snow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the wandering bees cannot lineendhere bear to leave them; the sweet birds also lineendhere come there to roost . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in front there flows an ever -- running lineendhere stream; beneath there is built a little lineendhere flat terrace . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sometimes i sweep the flagstones lineendhere of the terrace; sometimes , in the wind , lineendhere i raise my cup and drink . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the flower -- branches screen my head lineendhere from the sun; the flower -- buds fall lineendhere down into my lap . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alone drinking , alone singing lineendhere my songs i do not notice that the lineendhere moon is level with the steps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the people of pa do not lineendhere care for flowers; all the spring lineendhere no one has come to look . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but their governor general , lineendhere alone with his cup of wine sits till evening lineendhere and will not move from the place ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my niece , who is six lineendhere years old , is called “miss tortoise”; my lineendhere daughter of three , -- little “summer dress . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” one is beginning to learn lineendhere to joke and talk; the other can already lineendhere recite poems and songs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at morning they play clinging lineendhere about my feet; at night they sleep lineendhere pillowed against my dress . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why , children , did you reach lineendhere the world so late , coming to me lineendhere just when my years are spent? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere young things draw our lineendhere feelings to them; old people lineendhere easily give their hearts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sweetest vintage lineendhere at last turns sour; the full lineendhere moon in the end begins to wane . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and so with men the bonds of lineendhere love and affection soon may change to a lineendhere load of sorrow and care . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but all the world is bound lineendhere by love’s ties; why did i think that i lineendhere alone should escape? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere trees growing -- right in front of lineendhere my window; the trees are high lineendhere and the leaves grow thick . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the distant mountain lineendhere view obscured by this , dimly lineendhere shows between . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one morning i took lineendhere knife and axe; with my own hand i lineendhere lopped the branches off . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ten thousand leaves fall about lineendhere my head; a thousand hills came lineendhere before my eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suddenly , as when clouds or mists break and straight through , lineendhere the blue sky appears; again , like the face of a friend one has lineendhere loved seen at last after an age of parting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere first there came a gentle lineendhere wind blowing; one by one the birds lineendhere flew back to the tree . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to ease my mind i gazed to lineendhere the south east; as my eyes wandered , lineendhere my thoughts went far away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of men there is none that has lineendhere not some preference; of things there is lineendhere none but mixes good with ill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was not that i did lineendhere not love the tender branches; but lineendhere better still , -- to see the green hills ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have been ill so long that lineendhere i do not count the days; at the southern lineendhere window , evening -- and again evening . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sadly chirping in the lineendhere grasses under my eaves the winter lineendhere sparrows morning and evening sing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by an effort i rise and lean lineendhere heavily on my bed; tottering i lineendhere step towards the door of the courtyard . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere by chance i meet a friend who lineendhere is coming to see me; just as if lineendhere i had gone specially to meet him . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they took my couch and placed it in lineendhere the setting sun; they spread my rug and lineendhere i leaned on the balcony -- pillar . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tranquil talk was better than lineendhere any medicine; gradually the lineendhere feelings came back to my numbed heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere little sleeping and much lineendhere grieving , -- the traveller rises at midnight lineendhere and looks back towards home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the sands are bright with moonlight lineendhere that joins the shores; the sail is white with lineendhere dew that has covered the boat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nearing the sea , the river grows lineendhere broader and broader: approaching autumn , -- the lineendhere nights longer and longer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thirty times we have lineendhere slept amid mists and waves , and lineendhere still we have not reached hang -- chow ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i grew up lineendhere at jung -- yang; i was still lineendhere young when i left . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on and on , -- forty years passed lineendhere till again i stayed for lineendhere the night at jung -- yang . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i went away , i lineendhere was only eleven or twelve; lineendhere this year i am turned fifty -- six . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yet thinking back to the lineendhere times of my childish games , whole and undimmed , lineendhere still they rise before me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old houses have all lineendhere disappeared; down in the village lineendhere none of my people are left . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it is not only that streets lineendhere and buildings have changed; but steep is level lineendhere and level changed to steep ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere alone unchanged , the waters lineendhere of ch’iu and yu passionless , -- flow lineendhere in their old course . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while on the road to his new province , hang -- chow , in 822, lineendhere he sends a silver spoon to his niece a -- kuei , whom he had been obliged to leave lineendhere behind with her nurse , old mrs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere little girls ought to lineendhere be daintily lineendhere fed: mrs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ts’ao , lineendhere please see to lineendhere this ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that’s why i’ve packed and sent a lineendhere silver spoon; you will think of me and lineendhere eat up your food nicely ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere long ago to a white -- haired lineendhere gentleman you made the present lineendhere of a black gauze hat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the gauze hat still sits on lineendhere my head; but you already are gone lineendhere to the nether springs . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the thing is old , but still lineendhere fit to wear; the man is gone and lineendhere will never be seen again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere out on the hill the moon is lineendhere shining to -- night and the trees on your tomb lineendhere are swayed by the autumn wind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that so many of the lineendhere poor should suffer from cold what can lineendhere we do to prevent? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to bring warmth to lineendhere a single body lineendhere is not much use . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wish i had a big rug lineendhere ten thousand feet long , which at one time could cover lineendhere up every inch of the city . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our party scattered at yellow dusk lineendhere and i came home to bed; i woke at midnight and went for lineendhere a walk , leaning heavily on a friend . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as i lay on my pillow my vinous lineendhere complexion , soothed by sleep , grew sober; in front of the tower the ocean lineendhere moon , accompanying the tide , had risen . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the swallows , about to return to the beams , lineendhere went back to roost again; the candle at my window , just lineendhere going out , suddenly revived its light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all the time till dawn came , still my thoughts lineendhere were muddled; and in my ears something sounded lineendhere like the music of flutes and strings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere _then_ on the shore , -- building lineendhere sand -- pagodas; _now_, at court , covered with lineendhere tinkling jade . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere this and that , -- equally childish lineendhere games , things whose substance passes in lineendhere a moment of time ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while the hands are busy , the lineendhere heart cannot understand; when there are no lineendhere scriptures , then doctrine is sound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere even should one zealously lineendhere strive to learn the way , that very striving lineendhere will make one’s error more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all the morning i have lineendhere lain perversely in bed; now at lineendhere dusk i rise with many yawns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my warm stove is quick to lineendhere get ablaze; at the cold mirror i lineendhere am slow in doing my hair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with melted snow i lineendhere boil fragrant tea; seasoned with lineendhere curds i cook a milk -- pudding . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at my sloth and greed there lineendhere is no one but me to laugh; my cheerful vigour lineendhere none but myself knows . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the taste of my wine is mild and lineendhere works no poison; the notes of my harp lineendhere are soft and bring no sadness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere to the three joys in the book lineendhere of mencius i have added the lineendhere fourth of playing with my baby -- boy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i break up cypress lineendhere and make a book -- box; the box lineendhere well -- made , -- and the cypress -- wood tough . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in it shall be lineendhere kept what author’s lineendhere works? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the inscription lineendhere says po lineendhere lo -- t’ien . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all my life has been spent lineendhere in writing books , from when i was young lineendhere till now that i am old . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere first and last , -- seventy lineendhere whole volumes; big and little , -- three lineendhere thousand themes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all i can do is to divide them lineendhere among my daughters to be left by them lineendhere to give to my grandchildren . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere between thirty and forty , one is lineendhere distracted by the five lusts; between seventy and eighty , lineendhere one is a prey to a hundred diseases . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but from fifty to lineendhere sixty one is free from all ills; lineendhere calm and still -- the heart enjoys rest . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have put behind me love and greed; i lineendhere have done with profit and fame; i am still short of illness lineendhere and decay and far from decrepit age . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere strength of limb i still possess to lineendhere seek the rivers and hills; still my heart has spirit lineendhere enough to listen to flutes and strings . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at leisure i open new lineendhere wine and taste several cups; drunken i recall lineendhere old poems and sing a whole volume . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” hundreds of houses , lineendhere thousands of houses , -- like lineendhere a chess -- board . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the twelve streets lineendhere like a field planted with lineendhere rows of cabbage . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the distance perceptible , dim , lineendhere dim -- the fire of approaching dawn; and a single row lineendhere of stars lying to the west of the five gates . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mounting on high i begin to realize lineendhere the smallness of man’s domain; gazing into distance i begin lineendhere to know the vanity of the carnal world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i turn my head and hurry lineendhere home -- back to the court and market , a single lineendhere grain of rice falling -- into the great barn . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere two top -- knots not lineendhere yet plaited into lineendhere one . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of thirty lineendhere years -- just beyond lineendhere half . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you who are really a lady lineendhere of silks and satins are now become my lineendhere hill and stream companion ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the spring fountains together lineendhere we splash and play: on the lovely trees lineendhere together we climb and sport . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere her cheeks grow rosy , as lineendhere she quickens her sleeve -- dancing: her brows grow sad , lineendhere as she slows her song’s tune . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere don’t go singing the song of lineendhere the willow branches , when there’s no one lineendhere here with a heart for you to break ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at night you came and took my hand and we wandered lineendhere together in my dream; when i woke in the morning there was no one to lineendhere stop the tears that fell on my handkerchief . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere on the banks of the ch’ang my aged body lineendhere three times has passed through sickness; at hsien -- yang to the grasses lineendhere on your grave eight times has autumn come . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you lie buried beneath lineendhere the springs and your bones are lineendhere mingled with the clay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i -- lodging in the lineendhere world of men; my hair lineendhere white as snow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a -- wei and han -- lang both followed in lineendhere their turn; among the shadows of the terrace lineendhere of night did you know them or not? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at night , in my lineendhere dream , i stoutly climbed lineendhere a mountain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere going out alone lineendhere with my staff of lineendhere holly -- wood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a thousand crags , a hundred hundred valleys -- in lineendhere my dream -- journey none were unexplored and all the while my feet never grew tired lineendhere and my step was as strong as in my young days . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere can it be that when the lineendhere mind travels backward the body also lineendhere returns to its old state? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and can it be , as between lineendhere body and soul , that the body may lineendhere languish , while the soul is still strong? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere soul and body -- both are lineendhere vanities: dreaming and waking -- both lineendhere alike unreal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the day my feet are palsied lineendhere and tottering; in the night my steps lineendhere go striding over the hills . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as day and night are lineendhere divided in equal parts -- between the lineendhere two , i _get_ as much as i _lose_. lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere congratulating himself on lineendhere the comforts of his life after his lineendhere retirement from office . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lined coat , warm cap and easy felt slippers , lineendhere in the little tower , at the low window , sitting lineendhere over the sunken brazier . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere body at rest , lineendhere heart at peace; no need to lineendhere rise early . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i wonder if the courtiers lineendhere at the western capital know lineendhere of these things , or not? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere no new poems his lineendhere brush will trace: even lineendhere his fame is dead . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere his old poems are deep lineendhere in dust at the bottom of lineendhere boxes and cupboards . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once lately , when someone was singing , lineendhere suddenly i heard a verse -- before i had time lineendhere to catch the words a pain had stabbed my heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “those who speak know lineendhere nothing; those who know lineendhere are silent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” these words , as lineendhere i am told , were spoken lineendhere by lao -- tzŭ. lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if we are to believe that lao -- tzŭ lineendhere was himself _one who knew_, how comes it that he wrote lineendhere a book of five thousand words? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere chuang -- tzŭ levels all things lineendhere and reduces them to lineendhere the same monad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but _i_ say that lineendhere even in their sameness lineendhere difference may be found . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere a traveller lineendhere came from across the seas telling lineendhere of strange sights . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere “in a deep fold of the lineendhere sea -- hills i saw a terrace lineendhere and tower . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in the midst there lineendhere stood a fairy temple with lineendhere one niche empty . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they all told me lineendhere this was waiting lineendhere for lo -- t’ien to come . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ” traveller , i have studied the empty gate; lineendhere i am no disciple of fairies the story you lineendhere have just told is nothing but an idle tale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the hills of lineendhere ocean shall never lineendhere be lo -- t’ien’s home . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when i leave the earth lineendhere it will be to go to the heaven lineendhere of bliss fulfilled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they have put my bed beside the lineendhere unpainted screen; they have shifted my stove lineendhere in front of the blue curtain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i listen to my grandchildren , lineendhere reading me a book; i watch the servants , lineendhere heating up my soup . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with rapid pencil i answer lineendhere the poems of friends; i feel in my pockets lineendhere and pull out medicine -- money . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when this superintendence of lineendhere trifling affairs is done , i lie back on my lineendhere pillows and sleep with my face to the south . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the end chiswick lineendhere press: printed by charles lineendhere whittingham and co . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tooks court , lineendhere chancery lineendhere lane , london . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 21, heading , for lineendhere biographical read lineendhere bibliographical . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you , stand here at my lineendhere side , good priapus -- albeit from thieves lineendhere i've nothing to fear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere freely lineendhere pluck , whosoever lineendhere would eat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- hypocrites , those lineendhere are lineendhere the ones ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tell me ye stones and lineendhere give me o glorious lineendhere palaces answer . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere speak o lineendhere ye streets but lineendhere one word . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere genius , art lineendhere thou lineendhere alive? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yes , here within thy sanctified lineendhere walls there's a soul in each object , lineendhere roma eternal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for me , only , lineendhere are all things lineendhere yet mute . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who will then tell me in whispers lineendhere and where must i find just the window where one day she'll lineendhere be glimpsed: creature who'll scorch me with love? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere can't i divine yet the paths through lineendhere which over and over to her and from her lineendhere i'll go , squandering valuable time? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere visiting churches and palaces , all lineendhere of the ruins and the pillars , i , a responsible lineendhere man , profit from making this trip . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere with my business accomplished , ah , lineendhere then shall only one temple , amor's temple lineendhere alone , take the initiate in . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rome , thou art a whole world , it lineendhere is true , and yet without love this world would not be the lineendhere world , rome would cease to be rome . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere more than ever i lineendhere dreamed , i have found it: my lineendhere happy good fortune ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cupid lineendhere sagaciously led lineendhere past those palazzos so fine . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he of course knows very well (and i lineendhere have also discovered) what , beneath tapestries lineendhere rich , gilded boudoirs conceal . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one may if one wishes lineendhere call him a blind , wanton boy -- but i know you , lineendhere clever cupid , too well ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o , lineendhere incorruptible lineendhere god ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here he provides me with ev'rything , lineendhere sees that i get what i call for; each day that passes lineendhere he spreads freshly plucked roses for me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- isn't that lineendhere heaven lineendhere on earth? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere say , beautiful lineendhere lady borghese , what would you lineendhere give to me more? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere banquets and game lineendhere tables , operas , balls , promenades lineendhere down the corso? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these but deprive lineendhere my sweet boy of his lineendhere most opportune times . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere finery , lineendhere haughtiness do lineendhere not entice me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere does one not lift a lineendhere gown of the finest brocade just as lineendhere one lifts common wool? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere if she's to press in comfort a lineendhere lover against that soft bosom , doesn't he want lineendhere her to be free from all brooches and chains? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere must not the jewelry , and then the lineendhere lace and the bustles and whalebone all of it come lineendhere off entire , if he's to learn how she feels? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i encounter lineendhere no troubles lineendhere like those . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere simple dress of rough homespun , lineendhere at but a lover's mere touch , tumbles lineendhere in folds to the floor . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere quickly he carries the girl as lineendhere she's clad in chemise of coarse linen -- just as a nursemaid lineendhere might , playfully up to her bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere drapings of satin lineendhere are absent; the mattress is lineendhere quite unembroidered . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere large is this room where lineendhere the bed offers its lineendhere comfort for two . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere jupiter's welcome to more from his lineendhere juno if he can get it; let any mortal find lineendhere rest , softer , wherever he can . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we are content with cupid's delights , lineendhere authentic and naked -- and with the exquisite lineendhere creak /crack of the bed as it rocks . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ask whomever you will but you'll lineendhere never find out where i'm lodging , high society's lineendhere lords , ladies so groomed and refined . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "tell me , lineendhere was werther lineendhere authentic? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere did all of lineendhere that happen in lineendhere real life? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " "lotte , oh where did she lineendhere live , werther's only lineendhere true love? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " how many times have i cursed those lineendhere frivolous pages that broadcast out among all lineendhere mankind passions i felt in my youth ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere were he my brother , lineendhere why then i 'd have murdered lineendhere poor werther . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yet his despondent lineendhere ghost couldn't have sought lineendhere worse revenge . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do not , beloved , regret that lineendhere you yielded to me so quickly: i entertain lineendhere no base , insolent thoughts about you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere arrows lineendhere of cupid work divers lineendhere effects . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere some do but scratch us: lineendhere slow and insidious these lineendhere poison our hearts over years . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yet with a head freshly honed and lineendhere cunningly fledged , certain others pierce to the marrow , lineendhere inflame rapidly there our blood . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when gods and goddesses in days of lineendhere heroes made love , then lust followed look and desire , lineendhere with no delay , was indulged . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere surely you don't think the goddess of lineendhere love lost a moment reflecting when , in lineendhere idean grove , anchises caught her eye . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nor did luna delay about kissing lineendhere that beautiful dreamer -- jealous aurora had lineendhere else hastily wakened the lad . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere at the loud banquet hero regarded lineendhere leander -- then promptly into dark waters he plunged , lineendhere ardently swam toward his love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere today a proud rome lineendhere claims to be queen lineendhere of the world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we are lineendhere so pious , lineendhere we lovers . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere discreetly we worship lineendhere all powers , hoping for favor from each lineendhere god and each goddess as well . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere therefore we gladly confess to singling lineendhere a special immortal and our devotions each lineendhere day pledging but solely to her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mischievous celebrants we at these lineendhere mysteries gay , and so solemn: silence exactly lineendhere befits rites at which we're adepts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sweet lineendhere opportunity , lineendhere that is her name . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you lineendhere should lineendhere meet her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere often will she lineendhere turn up , ever lineendhere in a new form . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere daughter of proteus lineendhere might well she be whom he sired lineendhere upon thetis . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in metamorphoses lineendhere they've many a hero lineendhere deceived . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so now the daughter beguiles the naive lineendhere and bedazzles the foolish , teases you while you're lineendhere asleep; when you awaken , she's flown . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere eagerly yields herself lineendhere up to the quick , to the active lineendhere man only . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he discovers lineendhere she's tame , playful and lineendhere tender and sweet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once she appeared to me , too: lineendhere a dark -- skinned girl , tumbling over her forehead lineendhere the hair down in waves heavy and dark . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere round about a delicate neck lineendhere curled short little ringlets; up from the crown of lineendhere her head crinkled the unbraided hair . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when she dashed lineendhere by me i seized her , lineendhere mistaking her not . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lovingly kiss and lineendhere embrace she returned , knowing lineendhere and teaching me how . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o how lineendhere enraptured lineendhere i was ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , say lineendhere now no lineendhere more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it's lineendhere a lineendhere bygone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but , o pigtails lineendhere of rome , still i'm lineendhere entrammled in you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere happily now on lineendhere classical soil i feel lineendhere inspiration . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere voices from present lineendhere and past speak here lineendhere evocatively . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere heeding ancient advice , lineendhere i leaf through the works of the ancients lineendhere with an assiduous hand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere daily lineendhere the pleasure's lineendhere renewed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere throughout the night , in a different lineendhere way , i'm kept busy by cupid -- if erudition lineendhere is halved , rapture is doubled that way . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere do then i not become wise when lineendhere i trace with my eye her sweet bosom's form , and lineendhere the line of her hips stroke with my hand? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i acquire , as i reflect and compare , lineendhere my first understanding of marble , see with an eye lineendhere that feels , feel with a hand that sees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere while my beloved , i grant it , lineendhere deprives me of moments of daylight , she in lineendhere the nighttime hours gives compensation in full . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and we do more than just kiss; we lineendhere prosecute reasoned discussions (should she succumb to lineendhere sleep , that gives me time for my thoughts). lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in her embrace -- it's by no means unusual -- i've composed poems lineendhere and the hexameter's beat gently tapped out on her back , fingertips counting lineendhere in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere air from deep in lineendhere her breast penetrates lineendhere mine and there burns . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cupid , while stirring the flame in our lineendhere lamp , no doubt thinks of those days when for the triumvirs lineendhere he similar service performed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "can you be cruel lineendhere enough to sadden me thus with lineendhere reproaches? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere germans speak , lineendhere i suppose , bitterly lineendhere when they're in love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bear it i must when the lineendhere gossips bring forth accusations: lineendhere i'm guilty -- or am i not? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but , alas , all lineendhere of my guilt was lineendhere with you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere clothes that you've given bear witness for lineendhere envious neighbors that the poor widow no lineendhere more grieves for her husband alone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere did you not thoughtlessly visit lineendhere me in the disguise of a cleric , muffled all up in lineendhere a cloak , hair all rounded behind? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who was lineendhere it chose that gray monk if lineendhere not you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere well then a prelate lineendhere now is my lover -- ah , who is lineendhere my prelate but you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere never , incredible as it lineendhere may sound in this clerical city , has any cleric lineendhere brought me -- swear it i will -- to his bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i was lineendhere sufficiently lineendhere poor , sad to say . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lineendhere seducers noted lineendhere it well . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere falconier lineendhere ogled me often lineendhere enough . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one of the pimps for albani lineendhere with billets doux very impressive lineendhere called me to ostia once . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere quattro lineendhere fontani lineendhere next time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who was lineendhere it did not appear lineendhere there? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why , who but the very lineendhere same girl who hated with all of her heart lineendhere stockings both violet and red . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for: 'in the end you lineendhere poor girls are the ones who are lineendhere sure to be cheated . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ' so said my lineendhere father although -- mother was lineendhere not much impressed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere father lineendhere was lineendhere right . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here i stand in lineendhere the end being cheated lineendhere and scolded . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you don't believe lineendhere your own lineendhere words . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they're your lineendhere excuse to lineendhere escape . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere unworthy lineendhere of women are lineendhere men . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we , who carry your children lineendhere next to our hearts , in these hearts loyalty lineendhere we bear you , too . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as for you men , when you've poured out your lineendhere potency in our embraces and your desires lineendhere dissipate , love with them passes away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " these things expressed , and taking her child lineendhere from its chair , my beloved presses it close to lineendhere her heart , kisses it , tears in her eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'm now so very ashamed of lineendhere myself for having permitted gossip of neighbors lineendhere to spoil picture so eloquent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for a short moment lineendhere a fire may burn darkly lineendhere while smoke swirls about it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere water dashed on lineendhere the coals suddenly smothers lineendhere their glow . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rapidly then renewed heat overcomes lineendhere those lowering vapors , sends up a flame that anew lineendhere bright and more powerful gleams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how very happy i am here lineendhere in rome when i think of the bad days far back lineendhere there in the north , wrapped in a grayish light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere over my head there the heavens weighed lineendhere down so dismal and gloomy; colorless , formless , lineendhere that world round this exhausted man lay . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere seeking myself in myself , an lineendhere unsatisfied spirit , i brooded , spying out pathways lineendhere dark , lost in dreary reflection . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere phoebus the god lineendhere evokes forms , clear are lineendhere his colors by day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bright with the stars comes the evening , lineendhere ringing with songs that are tender , and the glow lineendhere of the moon , brighter than northern sun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what lineendhere blessedness mortals lineendhere may know ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere am lineendhere i now lineendhere dreaming? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere or welcomes lineendhere jupiter , father , as guest -- me , lineendhere to ambrosial halls? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see , i lie here lineendhere extending my arms lineendhere toward your knees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am praying: lineendhere hospitality's god , lineendhere jupiter xenius ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hear: how i am come lineendhere to this place i no longer lineendhere can say -- i was seized up by hebe . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere 'twas she lineendhere led to this sacred lineendhere hill . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere did you command her lineendhere a hero to seek and lineendhere deliver before you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere may be lineendhere she lineendhere erred . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let her lineendhere mistake profit lineendhere me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere does not fortuna , your daughter , lineendhere when strewing her glorious presents , after the manner lineendhere of girls , yield to each passing whim? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you , o hospitable god , will by lineendhere no means now banish a stranger from your olympian lineendhere heights back to the base earth again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " -- forgive me , jupiter , is not lineendhere rome's capitoline hill second lineendhere olympus to you? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere suffer me , jupiter , here and lineendhere let hermes guide me at last then past cestius' lineendhere tomb gently to orkus below . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when you were small , you say , neither did others consider lineendhere you f air , nor even your mother find praise -- and i believe it -- till you grew lineendhere bigger , developing quietly over the years . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i picture you lineendhere to myself as an lineendhere unusual child . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere also the blossoms on grapevines are wanting lineendhere in shape and in color , although the fruit when it's lineendhere ripe pleases both mankind and gods . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere kindling autumnal fire in a lineendhere rustic , convivial fireplace (how the sticks crackle lineendhere and spew flames and glittering sparks ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) strikes me lineendhere especially pleasant lineendhere this evening . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then in the morning , officious , lineendhere she'll leave the bed of her lover , rouse adroitly lineendhere the flames out from their ashes anew . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cupid has lent to her above lineendhere others the gift of cajoling up from the ashes lineendhere desire , just when slumber's begun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere therefore , ye living , rejoice that lineendhere love keeps you warm for a while yet , until cold lineendhere lethe anoints , captures your foot in its flight . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they are for you , o ye graces , just a lineendhere few leaves by a poet onto your pure altar laid , buds lineendhere of the rose beside , offered in confidence . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but it's to bacchus , the sensuous lineendhere dreamer , cythera sends glances bathed in sweetest lineendhere desire -- even in marble they're damp . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thinking about his embrace and its lineendhere pleasures , she seems to be asking shouldn't our lineendhere glorious son here at our side stand erect? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere can't you hear voices , lineendhere beloved , out on the via lineendhere flamina? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere reapers are now lineendhere going home , back from lineendhere harvesting grain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they had journeyed to rome from afar , lineendhere and here plaited for ceres wreaths which the romans lineendhere today scorn to make for themselves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere festivals no longer celebrate lineendhere ceres , the nourishing goddess who replaced acorns lineendhere of old , giving man golden wheat . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let us commemorate her lineendhere then ourselves in festival private (two constitute lineendhere a whole tribe , when they are two in love). lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere have you by any chance heard how that lineendhere mystical , strange celebration followed victorious lineendhere troops back from eleusis to rome? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere greeks were the ones who began it , and lineendhere only to greeks they proclaimed it even within roman lineendhere walls: "come to the sanctified night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " those who were not of the cult kept lineendhere their distance; neophytes trembled , waiting in garments of lineendhere white , symbol of all that is pure . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then the initiates must aimlessly lineendhere wander about through the eerie circles of figures as lineendhere if pilgriming through their own dreams . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere snakes on the lineendhere ground were writhing lineendhere about . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere surely the gestures of murmuring lineendhere priests must contain some deep meaning -- impatient lineendhere acolytes wait , anxiously hoping for light . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere not until after many a testing lineendhere and trial did they discover what , within sacred lineendhere ring , secretive image concealed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere what was this mystery other lineendhere than this: that demeter , goddess , once upon a lineendhere time had to a hero been kind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was to jason , powerful king lineendhere of the cretans , she granted of her immortal lineendhere self hidden sweet parts to explore . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that made lineendhere the fortune lineendhere of crete ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the marital bed of the lineendhere goddess soon grew pregnant with grain , heavy lineendhere her bounteous fields . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as for the rest of the world , it lineendhere languished away , while ceres , derelict of her true lineendhere task , dalliance offered in love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- now the initiate youths , having lineendhere followed this tale , all astonished , turned and beckoned lineendhere their loves -- love , do you comprehend? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere see there the sacred lineendhere shade beneath that bushy -- boughed lineendhere myrtle? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere our satisfaction lineendhere will there scarcely endanger lineendhere a world . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cupid is always lineendhere a scoundrel , and if you believe lineendhere him he'll cheat you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here's what the hypocrite lineendhere said: "trust me just once lineendhere more , this time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i have the best of intentions toward lineendhere you who have now dedicated -- i recognize lineendhere it with thanks -- life and writings to me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lo , i have followed you hither to lineendhere rome , and i'd like to do something here in this far away lineendhere land pleasing to such an old friend . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere every traveller i've ever lineendhere known has complained of poor treatment: he whom i lineendhere recommend treatment delicious receives . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how you've revered lineendhere the formative will of lineendhere those ancient artists ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere in their own lineendhere ateliers often i lineendhere 've visited them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as for their works , why , lineendhere i formed those myself -- now this time lineendhere i'm boasting not . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh come now , admit lineendhere what i am saying lineendhere is true . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where are your own lineendhere creations , your service to lineendhere me having slackened? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where is lineendhere invention's lineendhere glow now? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where is lineendhere the color lineendhere all gone? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere friend , do you lineendhere hope you can create lineendhere again? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- the school of the ancients lineendhere yet remains lineendhere open . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere its gates , lineendhere years have not closed lineendhere them to you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am eternally lineendhere young , and as teacher i still lineendhere love the young ones . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wisdom that comes lineendhere with old age pleases lineendhere me not . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere listen here: wasn't lineendhere antiquity young when those fortunate lineendhere ancients were living? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere happy then be lineendhere your life , too: in it lineendhere antiquity lives . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere where will lineendhere you find a fit theme for lineendhere your song? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- it is lineendhere i must lineendhere provide it . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as for a style lineendhere truly grand , love can lineendhere alone give you that . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " all of these claims lineendhere that sophist lineendhere asserted . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere could i lineendhere contradict lineendhere him? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i am wont to lineendhere obey , when my lineendhere commander decrees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere treacherous now he is keeping his word: lineendhere giving me themes for my poems while he is stealing lineendhere my time , potency , presence of mind . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gazing into her eyes , holding hands , giving kisses , lineendhere exchanging syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand , murmuring our lineendhere conversations we stutter in sweet oratory . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hymns of such sort pass lineendhere away , wanting lineendhere prosodical tact . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere goddess of morning , lineendhere aurora , as friend of my lineendhere muse i once knew you . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere has the unprincipled lineendhere god , cupid , seduced lineendhere you now too? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere so that these mornings you come as his lineendhere sweetheart , awakening me at his festive altar lineendhere again , where i must celebrate him? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere here on my breast flows her hair , an lineendhere abundance of curls , while her head rests , pressing my lineendhere arm as it's bent , so as to pillow her neck . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love in our hearts makes us one , lineendhere as the genuine need there stays constant; only lineendhere returning desire knows oscillation or change . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere gently her hand presses lineendhere mine , now she opens her eyes and is lineendhere looking into my own eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let my lineendhere thoughts rest lineendhere on your form ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere please lineendhere close your lineendhere eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they're inebriation , lineendhere confusion , they rob me all too soon of lineendhere the joy quiet reflection affords . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere grand are the forms of lineendhere this body and nobly lineendhere positioned each member . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere had ariadne lineendhere lain thus , theseus lineendhere never had fled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only a single kiss for lineendhere these lips and then , o theseus , leave lineendhere her; look at her eyes -- she's awake ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now you're lineendhere eternally lineendhere bound . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere boy , won't lineendhere you light me lineendhere a lamp . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "but dear master , lineendhere there's light in the sky lineendhere yet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere don't waste lineendhere your oil and lineendhere the wick . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere don't close lineendhere the shutters lineendhere so soon . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere only the houses lineendhere are blocking the sun there , it's lineendhere not yet the mountains . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere until the curfew lineendhere shall ring , full half an lineendhere hour must pass . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " wretched young lineendhere fellow , be gone and lineendhere obey me ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my loved lineendhere one is lineendhere coming . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere lamplight , console lineendhere me till then , harbinger lineendhere warm of the night . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere poets of old in chorus cried out against those lineendhere two serpents , making them horrible names , hated in all of the world: python lineendhere the one , the other the hydra of lerna . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere these monsters both lineendhere have now been destroyed , thanks to the lineendhere deeds of the gods . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fire -- breathing , venomous once , they lineendhere no longer now depredate our flocks lineendhere and meadows and woods , fields of golden grain . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how is it then that some spiteful lineendhere god in his wrath has raised from the poisonous slime offspring lineendhere so monstrous again? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere there's an insidious viper creeps lineendhere into the loveliest gardens , lying in wait lineendhere to attack all who seek pleasure therein . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere noble hesperian lineendhere dragon , i call you courageous lineendhere and forthright . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere boldly defending lineendhere your own beautiful apples lineendhere of gold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as for this worm , why he is not guarding lineendhere at all , for his presence sullies both garden and lineendhere fruit , till they deserve no defense . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere happy lucretius knew how in lineendhere his day to forego love completely , fearing not lineendhere to enjoy pleasure in anyone's arms . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fortunate ancient , propertius , lineendhere for you a slave fetched the girls down from the lineendhere aventine hill , from tarpeia's grove . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cynthia then , when driving you out lineendhere of such unchaste embraces , found you unfaithful , lineendhere it's true , but she did find you whole . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere who would today dare attempt lineendhere to escape from fidelity's lineendhere ennui? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere love does not lineendhere hold one back -- only concern lineendhere for one's health . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere even the woman we love may afford lineendhere us uncertain enjoyment; nowhere can feminine lineendhere lap safely encouch a man's head . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere matrimonial bed's insecure lineendhere and so's fornication; husband , lover and lineendhere wife pass to each other the hurt . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere think of those ages of gold when lineendhere jupiter followed his urges , chose callisto lineendhere one day , turned to semel the next . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it was important to him to find lineendhere thresholds of temples so sacred pure when , enamoured , lineendhere he sought powerful entry to them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere can you imagine the ragings of lineendhere juno if in love's skirmish poisonous weapons on lineendhere her by her own spouse had been turned? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but we neo -- pagans may not after all be lineendhere abandoned entirely: yet there is speeding a god mercifully lineendhere over the earth , quick and assiduous . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere everyone knows him and ought lineendhere to adore him , herald of zeus: lineendhere hermes , the healing god . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cupid will hold out his hand: o , and entrusting lineendhere myself to the rascal , i beg you please may i do so in pleasure lineendhere with no danger or worry or fear . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i cannot think i'd have gone with lineendhere julius caesar to britain; to the popina lineendhere right here , florus would tug me with ease . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fogs of the dreary north remain lineendhere a more baleful remembrance than in the kitchens lineendhere of rome tribes of assiduous fleas . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere after today , i'll remember you even lineendhere more kindly , tavernas , you osterias , as you lineendhere are called , aptly by those here in rome . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that was the place i encountered my lineendhere mistress today with the uncle whom she so often lineendhere deceives , so that she can have me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she is of course well aware that lineendhere i am watching , so finally makes the v of the lineendhere roman five , with a virgule before . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere quickly , as soon as i've seen , she interlaces lineendhere the circles , reducing them all to ornatest patterns -- but still the lineendhere sweet iv stood as engraved in my eye . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost lineendhere bloody half from delight at the ruse , partly from stifled desire: such a lineendhere long time until dark , then another four hours of waiting . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- sun , who tarries on high , contemplating rome: greater lineendhere never you've nor shall you in future see greater than rome , o lineendhere sun , as your priest , horace , enraptured foretold . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere tarry lineendhere no longer lineendhere today . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere go seek other lineendhere realms beneath lineendhere heaven . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere sooner depart lineendhere and leave rome's seven lineendhere famed hills to me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere please do the poet a favor lineendhere and shorten the glorious hours which the painter lineendhere devours , eagerly filling his eyes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere then hastily lineendhere plunge to the lineendhere ocean . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere first were but few simple dwellings here , lineendhere suddenly sunlight discovered nations enlivening lineendhere hills teeming with fortunate thieves . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere onto this spot they assembled such lineendhere plunder , in your eye so splendid all earth's remaining lineendhere orb scarcely was worthy of note . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you watched a world being born here , watched lineendhere the same world sink to ruin , and from those ruins lineendhere yet arise world again greater , perhaps . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o may i lineendhere long by your light lineendhere now behold this rome . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o but come rushing lineendhere the moment my love designated lineendhere so sweetly . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere -- no , but lineendhere i heard at least lineendhere three . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere thus , my dear muses , lineendhere again you've beguiled the lineendhere monotony for me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere of this long interval lineendhere while i was apart lineendhere from my love . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere all lineendhere of you now , lineendhere farewell ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i'll be going lineendhere now -- don't be lineendhere offended . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for , though you're proud , you'll lineendhere concede: cupid in lineendhere my heart comes first . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere why did you fail to lineendhere appear at the cot in the lineendhere vineyard today , love? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere as i had promised lineendhere i would , long i awaited lineendhere you there . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "dear , i had almost arrived when i lineendhere saw , by good fortune , your uncle standing right there by lineendhere the vines , looking now this way , now that . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere stealthily lineendhere i slipped lineendhere away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere you saw lineendhere the scarecrow , lineendhere that's all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nothing lineendhere else drove you lineendhere away . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere reeds and some discarded garments all lineendhere hastily cobbled together -- i helped to make lineendhere it myself: diligent in my own grief . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "well , now lineendhere his wish lineendhere is fulfilled . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the old gardner's most dissolute lineendhere crow has left on this day unscathed nice little lineendhere garden and niece . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " while there is many an lineendhere unpleasant sound , i hate to hear barking lineendhere worse than anything else . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere bellowing lineendhere dogs split my lineendhere ears . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nevertheless i do like to hear , lineendhere and take pleasure in listening to the loud lineendhere howl of the dog raised from a pup next door . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that is the dog that so bayed one time lineendhere at my girl that he almost gave our secret lineendhere away (when she was visiting me). lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , when i hear the dog barking i think lineendhere my beloved is coming -- or i remember lineendhere the time , when long awaited she came . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i can tell not only about a discomfort lineendhere far greater than others , but of a horror besides , thinking of which lineendhere will arouse every fiber in me to revulsion . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my friends , i confess it: lineendhere great displeasure i take lying lineendhere alone in my bed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that's why faustina as my companion lineendhere in bed makes me happy: loving she always remains lineendhere faithful , as i am to her . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere young men are aroused in their passions by lineendhere obstacles and by excitement; i prefer to lineendhere go slow , savoring pleasures secure . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere is it not bliss to exchange tender lineendhere kisses containing no dangers , sucking into our lineendhere lungs , carefree , our partner's own life? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere that is the way our lineendhere long nights of enjoyment lineendhere are passed . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere we listen , breast against breast , to the storm , pouring down rain lineendhere in the wind morning begins to dawn , we expect from these hours approaching lineendhere blossoms that will adorn festive the coming new day . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere quirites , permit me the joy , and may lineendhere this , of all pleasures on earth the first and the last , lineendhere be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , to uphold lineendhere one's respectable lineendhere name is not easy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the lady fame lineendhere has an ancient foe: cupid , lineendhere my master and lord . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere oh , by the way , have lineendhere you heard of the cause of their lineendhere mutual hatred? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it's an old story , lineendhere i think -- let me just tell it lineendhere again . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere powerful ever the goddess , but lineendhere nevertheless to her fellows overbearing lineendhere and rude , quite unendurable . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she had by the gods since time out of lineendhere mind at their banquets been dreaded , yelling with brassiest lineendhere voice orders to great and to small . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere once , in her arrogance even maintained lineendhere that she had subjected to her own will , as her lineendhere slave , jove's most illustrious son . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere "one of these days , o father of lineendhere deities ," cried she in triumph , "i shall be lineendhere bringing you my -- hercules , as if new born . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere don't think that hercules be still that lineendhere boy whom alcmene once bore you; his adulation lineendhere of me makes him now god upon earth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere when toward olympus lineendhere he gazes , i've no doubt you hope that he's lineendhere looking piously toward your knees . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he's lineendhere looking lineendhere for me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere o the vision of winning my lineendhere favor makes easy hitherto unexplored paths , lineendhere under that powerful foot . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i do my part , for i meet him halfway lineendhere and proclaim his adventures praising his name in lineendhere advance , even before he's begun . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one day lineendhere you'll wed me to lineendhere hercules . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere hero who lineendhere amazons conquered that lineendhere day will overwhelm me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere happily lineendhere i'll call him: lineendhere spouse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " all of the gods kept their counsel , and lineendhere none would reply to the braggart , lest in a pique she lineendhere devise vengeance against one of them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere scene now completed and ready to tease , lineendhere he goes scampering , shouting for all olympus lineendhere to hear: "come , see these glorious deeds ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere heaven and earth and the sun on his lineendhere indefatigable journey over that lineendhere infinite path never did witness the like ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " everyone hastened , gulled by the lineendhere dissolute boy , who feigning earnest , had summoned lineendhere them all (fame by no means lagged behind). lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere which of the gods will lineendhere now smile in sweet condescension lineendhere on cupid? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere delighted , of course , lineendhere seeing a man lineendhere humbled so . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere fame , on the other lineendhere hand , stood there ashamed , embarrassed , lineendhere despairing . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere first she just lineendhere laughed , saying: "gods , be lineendhere not deceived . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere it's lineendhere a lineendhere masque . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i know my hero lineendhere too well to be fooled by lineendhere disguises of actors . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " soon , though , in lineendhere pain she perceived: hercules , lineendhere none but he . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere how those boys , bacchus and mercury , guffawed , and lineendhere freely admitted: sweet must be the repose , lying on bosom lineendhere so fine of this magnificent woman . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they turned to vulcan lineendhere entreating: "do not release lineendhere them just yet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let us lineendhere inspect them lineendhere once more . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " and the old cuckold lineendhere was cuckold enough to comply lineendhere with their wishes . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ) as for poor fame , lineendhere in all haste , burning lineendhere with wrath she must flee . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere since then no armistice lineendhere has been proclaimed to the feuding lineendhere between them . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere let her but favor lineendhere a man , hot in pursuit lineendhere is the boy . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere he whom fame honors most can least lineendhere defend against cupid , and her most dang'rous attacks lineendhere strike the most morally proud . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere whoever tries to lineendhere escape him is dragged down from lineendhere bad deeds to worse ones . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere yes , he will offer you girls -- if like a fool you despise lineendhere these , only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious: heat lineendhere of man's love for man , ardent desires toward beasts . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere for those ashamed of him cupid lineendhere reserves the bitterest passions , mingling for hypocrites lineendhere their pleasure in vice and remorse . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere but , at the same time , lineendhere the goddess seeks him , she's lineendhere watching and list'ning . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere should find him with you , ill disposed will she be: frighten lineendhere you , frowning austerely , contemptuously , violently casting into lineendhere the worst of repute houses he's known to frequent . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere ah , it's the lineendhere same with lineendhere me , too . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i haven't lineendhere escaped her , the lineendhere goddess . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere jealously she lineendhere seeks me out , sweet secret lineendhere love to expose . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i will submit to the ancient lineendhere law and in silence revere her , for , when great lords lineendhere fall out , i like the greeks must atone . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere however comely be strength , or lineendhere free and undaunted comportment , secrecy is for lineendhere a man most important of all . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere mighty subduer of cities , lineendhere discretion , o princess of nations , goddess whom lineendhere i adore , safely you've led me thus far . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , though , what lineendhere fate shall befall lineendhere me? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere my frivolous muse has lineendhere now opened -- cupid , the scamp -- opens lips lineendhere hitherto sealed so well . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere difficult is it , alas , to conceal the lineendhere shame of a monarch; hide it can neither his crown , nor a lineendhere tight phrygian cap: midas has asses ears ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere the first lineendhere servant discovers -- o lineendhere horror ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere shame of this secret lineendhere so weighs , midas lineendhere unburdens his heart . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere into the earth for safekeeping the lineendhere servant must bury the story , easing in this lineendhere way the king: earth must conceal the tale . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere reeds in a trice are sprouting and lineendhere rustling in murmuring breezes: "midas , o midas lineendhere the king -- bears the ears of an ass ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere " mine is a secret more pleasant , but lineendhere even more difficult keeping: out of abundance lineendhere of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere none of my ladyfriends dare i confide lineendhere in , for they would but chide me; nor any gentleman lineendhere friend , lest he be rival to me . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere rapture proclaim to lineendhere the grove , to the echoing lineendhere cliffs perorate it? lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere one can do that if lineendhere one's young , or if one's lineendhere lonely enough . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i to hexameters tell , in lineendhere pentameters i will confide it: during the lineendhere day she was joy , happiness all the night long . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere she's coming , and must lineendhere not be seen by lineendhere the neighbor ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere breezes , rustle lineendhere the leaves: muffle the lineendhere sound of her feet . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and as for you , little poems , o lineendhere grow and flower , your blossoms cradling themselves in lineendhere the air , tepid and soft with love's breath . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere wafting , betray to quirites , as lineendhere midas' reeds did with cheap gossip , one happy couple in lineendhere love , and their sweet secret , at last . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i in the back of the garden , lineendhere the last of the gods , in a corner , lineendhere ineptly formed , must i stand . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere evil lineendhere the inroads lineendhere of time . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere cucumber vines grow entwining lineendhere about this primeval lingam , cracking it almost lineendhere in two under the weight of the fruit . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere faggots are heaped all about me against the lineendhere cold of the winter , which i so hate for the crows settling then lineendhere down on my head , which they befoul very shamefully . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere summer's no better: the servants lineendhere empty their bowels and show insolent , lineendhere naked behinds . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere filth , lineendhere above and lineendhere below ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere i was clearly in danger lineendhere of turning into filth myself , toadstool , lineendhere rotten wood ! lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , by your efforts , o lineendhere noblest of artists , i shall recover with lineendhere fellow gods my just place . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere and it's lineendhere no more than lineendhere my due . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere jupiter's throne , so dishonestly lineendhere won , it was i who secured it: color and ivory , lineendhere marble and bronze , not to mention the poems . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere now , all intelligent lineendhere men look upon me lineendhere in kindness . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere they like to form their lineendhere own image of me , just as lineendhere the poet has done . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere nor do the girls take lineendhere offense when they see me -- by no lineendhere means the matrons . lineendhere endlinehere startlinehere none finds me ugly lineendhere today , though i am lineendhere monstrously strong . lineendhere endlinehere
