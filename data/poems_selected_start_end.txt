startlinehere the boat drifts to rest under the outward spraying branches endlinehere startlinehere she is an iris dark purple pale rose under the gnarled boughs that shatter their stars of bloom endlinehere startlinehere she waves delicately with the movement of the tree endlinehere startlinehere of what is she dreaming endlinehere startlinehere of long nights lit with orange lanterns of wine cups and compliments and kisses of the two sword men endlinehere startlinehere and of dawn when weary sleepers lie outstretched on the mats of the palace and of the iris stalk that is broken in the fountain endlinehere startlinehere autumn winds roll through the dry leaves on her garments autumn birds shiver athwart star hung skies endlinehere startlinehere under the blossoming plum tree she

endlinehere startlinehere she is like the great rains that fall over the earth in winter time endlinehere startlinehere gaily he offers packets of merchandise endlinehere startlinehere he is a harlequin of illusions his nimble features skip into smiles like rainbows cheating the villagers endlinehere startlinehere but in his heart all the while is another knowledge the sorrow of the bleakness of the long wet winter night endlinehere startlinehere one life is a long summer tall hollyhocks stand proud upon its paths little yellow waves of sunlight bring scarlet butterflies endlinehere startlinehere another life is a brief autumn fierce storm rack scrawled with lightning passed over it leaving the naked bleeding earth stabbed with the swords of the rain endlinehere startlinehere he plots for he is angry he sneers for he is bold endlinehere startlinehere he clinches his fist like a twisted snake coiling itself preparing to raise its head above the long grasses of the plain endlinehere startlinehere i have forgotten how many times he kissed me but i cannot forget a swaying branch a leaf that fell to earth endlinehere startlinehere he stands irresolute cloaking the light of his lantern endlinehere startlinehere tonight he will either find new love or a sword thrust but his soul is troubled with ghosts of old regret endlinehere startlinehere like vines with crimson flowers they climb upwards into his heart endlinehere startlinehere she was a dream of moons of fluttering handkerchiefs of flying leaves of parasols a riddle made to break my heart the lightest impulse to her was more dear than the deep toned temple bell endlinehere startlinehere she fluttered to my sword hilt an instant and then flew away but who will spend all day chasing a butterfly endlinehere startlinehere is it a vision under the moonlight endlinehere startlinehere no it is only a beautiful geisha swaying down the street endlinehere startlinehere out of the rings and the bubbles the curls and the swirls of the water out of the crystalline shower of drops shattered in play her body and her thoughts arose endlinehere startlinehere poems are falling from them swift as the wind that shakes the lance like bamboo leaves the stars close around like bubbles stirred by the silver oars of poems passing endlinehere startlinehere beware for the dying vine can hold the strongest oak endlinehere startlinehere only by cutting at the root can love be altered endlinehere startlinehere late in the night a rosy glimmer yet defies the darkness endlinehere startlinehere but the evening is growing late the blinds are being lowered she who held your heart and charmed you is only a rosy glimmer of flame remembered endlinehere startlinehere rain rattles on the pavement puddles stand in the bluish stones afar in the yoshiwara is she who holds my heart endlinehere startlinehere alas the torn lantern of my hope trembles and sputters in the rain endlinehere startlinehere i saw him pass at twilight he was a dark cloud travelling over palace roofs with one claw drooping endlinehere startlinehere one dainty thrust no more than this he needs endlinehere startlinehere his heart is like a wind torn between cloud and butterfly whether he will roll passively to one or chase endlessly the other endlinehere startlinehere my heart is broken and mournful as rain heard beating far off in the distance while earth is parched more near endlinehere startlinehere he only can bow to men lofty as a god to those beneath him who has taken sins and sorrows and whose deathless spirit leaps beneath them like a golden carp in the torrent endlinehere startlinehere but the laughing rains of spring will break the weak green shoots of their love endlinehere startlinehere his will grow a towering stalk hers a cowering flower under it endlinehere startlinehere would that the rains of all the winters might wash away my grief endlinehere startlinehere the cranes have come back to the temple the winds are flapping the flags about through a flute of reeds i will blow a song endlinehere startlinehere chrysanthemums bending before the wind endlinehere startlinehere chrysanthemums wavering in the black choked grasses endlinehere startlinehere the wind frowns at them he tears off a green and orange stalk of broken chrysanthemum endlinehere startlinehere the chrysanthemums spread their flattered heads and scurry off before the wind endlinehere startlinehere storm birds of autumn with draggled wings sleet beaten wind tattered snow frozen stopping in sheer weariness between the gnarled red pine trees twisted in doubt and despair whence do you come pilgrims over what snow fields endlinehere startlinehere to what southern province hidden behind dim peaks would you go endlinehere startlinehere too long were the telling wherefore we set out and where we will find rest only the gods may tell endlinehere startlinehere only beyond the still grey shoji for the breadth of innumerable countries is the sea with ships asleep in the blue black starless night endlinehere startlinehere a squall has struck the sea afar off endlinehere startlinehere you can feel it quiver over the paper parasol with which she shields her face in the drawn together skirts of her robes as she turns to meet it endlinehere startlinehere windy evening of autumn by the grey green swirling river people are resting like still boats tugging uneasily at their cramped chains endlinehere startlinehere some are moving slowly like the easy winds brown blue dull green the villages in the distance sleep on the banks of the river the waters sullenly clash and murmur endlinehere startlinehere the chatter of the passersby is dulled beneath the grey unquiet sky endlinehere startlinehere the green and violet peacocks through the golden dusk showered upon them from the vine hung lanterns stately nostalgically parade endlinehere startlinehere i will scrawl on the walls of the night faces endlinehere startlinehere leering sneering scowling threatening faces weeping twisting yelling howling faces faces fixed in a contortion between a scream and a laugh meaningless faces endlinehere startlinehere i will cover the walls of night with faces till you do not know if these faces are but masks or you the masks for them endlinehere startlinehere faces too grotesque for laughter faces too shattered by pain for tears faces of such ugliness that the ugliness grows beauty endlinehere startlinehere they will haunt you morning evening burning burning ever returning endlinehere startlinehere their own infamy creating till you strike at life and hate it burn your soul up so in hating endlinehere startlinehere i will scrawl on the walls of the night faces pitiless flaring staring endlinehere startlinehere the seasons passed for her like pale iris wilting or peonies flying to ribbons before the storm gusts endlinehere startlinehere the sombre pine tops waited until the seasons had passed endlinehere startlinehere my beloved is like blue smoke that rises in long slow planes and wavers over the dark paths of old gardens long neglected endlinehere startlinehere there was a city living here long ago of all that city there is only one stone left half buried in the marsh with characters upon it which no one now can read endlinehere startlinehere in my heart is the sorrow of years like red leaves buried in snow endlinehere startlinehere girls will laugh and scatter cherry petals sometimes they will rest in the twisted pine trees shade endlinehere startlinehere if one presses her warm lips to this tablet the dust of my body will feel a thrill deep down in the silent earth endlinehere startlinehere the sky spreads out its poor array of tattered flags saffron and rose over the weary huddle of housetops smoking their evening pipes in silence endlinehere startlinehere the city gleams with lights this evening like loud and yawning laughter from red lips endlinehere startlinehere as the fish that leaps from the river as the dropping of a november leaf at twilight as the faint flicker of lightning down the southern sky so i saw beauty far away endlinehere startlinehere i dreamed i caught your loveliness in little silver jars and when you died i opened them and there was only soot within endlinehere startlinehere rain fell so softly in the evening i almost thought it was the trees that were talking endlinehere startlinehere cities are the toy boxes time plays with and there are often many doll houses of which the dolls are lost endlinehere startlinehere a poets moods fluttering butterflies in the rain endlinehere startlinehere grass moves in the wind my soul is backwards blown endlinehere startlinehere land green brown sea brown grey island dull peacock blue sky stone grey endlinehere startlinehere a bell in the fog creeps out echoing faintly the pale broad flashes of vibrating twilight faded gold endlinehere startlinehere there is a goddess who walks shrouded by day at night she throws her blue veil over the earth endlinehere startlinehere men only see her naked glory through the little holes in the veil endlinehere startlinehere an old courtyard hidden away in the afternoon endlinehere startlinehere grey walks mossy stones copper carp swimming lazily and beyond a faint toneless hissing echo of rain that tears at my heart endlinehere startlinehere here i am an old man in a dry month being read to by a boy waiting for rain endlinehere startlinehere i was neither at the hot gates nor fought in the warm rain nor knee deep in the salt marsh heaving a cutlass bitten by flies fought endlinehere startlinehere my house is a decayed house and the jew squats on the window sill the owner spawned in some estaminet of antwerp blistered in brussels patched and peeled in london endlinehere startlinehere the goat coughs at night in the field overhead rocks moss stonecrop iron merds endlinehere startlinehere the woman keeps the kitchen makes tea sneezes at evening poking the peevish gutter endlinehere startlinehere i an old man a dull head among windy spaces endlinehere startlinehere signs

gives gives with such supple confusions that the giving famishes the craving endlinehere startlinehere gives too late whats not believed in or if still believed in memory only reconsidered passion endlinehere startlinehere gives too soon into weak hands whats thought can be dispensed with till the refusal propagates a fear endlinehere startlinehere think neither fear nor courage saves us

new year endlinehere startlinehere us he devours endlinehere startlinehere think at last we have not reached conclusion when i stiffen in a rented house endlinehere startlinehere think at last i have

heart was removed therefrom to lose beauty in terror terror in inquisition endlinehere startlinehere i have lost my passion why should i need to keep it since what is kept must be adulterated endlinehere startlinehere i have lost my sight smell hearing taste and touch how should i use it for your closer contact endlinehere startlinehere these with a thousand small deliberations protract

trampled street with all its muddy feet that press to early coffee stands endlinehere startlinehere with the other masquerades that time resumes one thinks of all the hands that are raising dingy shades in a thousand furnished rooms endlinehere startlinehere i am moved by fancies that are curled around these images and cling the notion of some infinitely gentle infinitely suffering thing endlinehere startlinehere wipe your hand across your mouth and laugh the worlds revolve like ancient women gathering fuel in vacant lots endlinehere startlinehere half past one the street lamp sputtered the street lamp muttered the street lamp said regard that woman who hesitates toward you in the light of the door which opens on her like a grin endlinehere startlinehere you see the border of her dress is torn and stained with sand and you see the corner of her eye twists like a crooked pin endlinehere startlinehere a broken spring in a factory yard rust that clings to the form that the strength has left hard and curled and ready to snap endlinehere startlinehere half past two the street lamp said remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter slips out its tongue and devours a morsel of rancid butter endlinehere startlinehere so the hand of the child automatic slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay endlinehere startlinehere i could see nothing behind that childs eye endlinehere startlinehere half past three the lamp sputtered the lamp muttered in the dark endlinehere startlinehere she smooths the hair of the grass endlinehere startlinehere the moon has lost her memory endlinehere startlinehere the reminiscence comes of sunless dry geraniums and dust in crevices smells of chestnuts in the streets and female smells in shuttered rooms and cigarettes in corridors and cocktail smells in bars endlinehere startlinehere the lamp said four oclock here is the number on the door endlinehere startlinehere you have the key the little lamp spreads a ring on the stair mount endlinehere startlinehere the bed is open the tooth brush hangs on the wall put your shoes at the door sleep prepare for life endlinehere startlinehere the last twist of the knife endlinehere startlinehere they are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens and along the trampled edges of the street i am aware of the damp souls of housemaids sprouting despondently at area gates endlinehere startlinehere the readers of the boston evening transcript sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn endlinehere startlinehere miss helen slingsby was my maiden aunt and lived in a small house near a fashionable square cared for by servants to the number of four endlinehere startlinehere now when she died there was silence in heaven and silence at her end of the street endlinehere startlinehere the shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet he was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before endlinehere startlinehere the dogs were handsomely provided for but shortly afterwards the parrot died too endlinehere startlinehere the dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece and the footman sat upon the dining table holding the second housemaid on his knees who had always been so careful while her mistress lived endlinehere startlinehere miss nancy ellicott strode across the hills and broke them rode across the hills and broke them the barren new england hills riding to hounds over the cow pasture endlinehere startlinehere miss nancy ellicott smoked and danced all the modern dances and her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it but they knew that it was modern endlinehere startlinehere upon the glazen shelves kept watch matthew and waldo guardians of the faith the army of unalterable law endlinehere startlinehere apollinax visited the united states his laughter tinkled among the teacups endlinehere startlinehere i thought of fragilion that shy figure among the birch trees and of priapus in the shrubbery gaping at the lady in the swing endlinehere startlinehere in the palace of mrs endlinehere startlinehere phlaccus at professor channing cheetahs he laughed like an irresponsible foetus endlinehere startlinehere i looked for the head of mr endlinehere startlinehere apollinax rolling under a chair or grinning over a screen with seaweed in its hair endlinehere startlinehere i heard the beat of centaurs hoofs over the hard turf as his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon endlinehere startlinehere he is a charming man but after all what did he mean endlinehere startlinehere he must be unbalanced there was something he said that i might have challenged endlinehere startlinehere of dowager mrs endlinehere startlinehere phlaccus and professor and mrs endlinehere startlinehere cheetah i remember a slice of lemon and a bitten macaroon endlinehere startlinehere as she laughed i was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and being part of it until her teeth were only accidental stars with a talent for squad drill endlinehere startlinehere i was drawn in by short gasps inhaled at each momentary recovery lost finally in the dark caverns of her throat bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles endlinehere startlinehere i decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be stopped some of the fragments of the afternoon might be collected and i concentrated my attention with careful subtlety to this end endlinehere startlinehere i observe our sentimental friend the moon endlinehere startlinehere or possibly fantastic i confess it may be prester johns balloon or an old battered lantern hung aloft to light poor travellers to their distress endlinehere startlinehere she then how you digress endlinehere startlinehere and i then some one frames upon the keys that exquisite nocturne with which we explain the night and moonshine music which we seize to body forth our vacuity endlinehere startlinehere she then does this refer to me endlinehere startlinehere oh no it is i who am inane endlinehere startlinehere you madam are the eternal humorist the eternal enemy of the absolute giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist endlinehere startlinehere with your air indifferent and imperious at a stroke our mad poetics to confute and are we then so serious endlinehere startlinehere o quam te memorem virgo endlinehere startlinehere i should find some way incomparably light and deft some way we both should understand simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand endlinehere startlinehere she turned away but with the autumn weather compelled my imagination many days many days and many hours her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers endlinehere startlinehere and i wonder how they should have been together endlinehere startlinehere i should have lost a gesture and a pose endlinehere startlinehere sometimes these cogitations still amaze the troubled midnight and the noons repose endlinehere startlinehere in winter i get up at night and dress by yellow candle light endlinehere startlinehere in summer quite the other way i have to go to bed by day endlinehere startlinehere i have to go to bed and see the birds still hopping on the tree or hear the grown up peoples feet still going past me in the street endlinehere startlinehere and does it not seem hard to you when all the sky is clear and blue and i should like so much to play to have to go to bed by day endlinehere startlinehere all night long and every night when my mamma puts out the light i see the people marching by as plain as day before my eye endlinehere startlinehere armies and emperors and kings all carrying different kinds of things and marching in so grand a way you never saw the like by day endlinehere startlinehere so fine a show was never seen at the great circus on the green for every kind beast and man is marching in that caravan endlinehere startlinehere at first they move a little slow but still the faster on they go and still beside them close i keep until we reach the town of sleep endlinehere startlinehere three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing endlinehere startlinehere three of us aboard in the basket on the lea endlinehere startlinehere winds are in the air they are blowing in the spring and waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea endlinehere startlinehere where shall we adventure to day that were afloat wary of the weather and steering by a star endlinehere startlinehere shall it be to africa a steering of the boat to providence or babylon or off to malabar endlinehere startlinehere but heres a squadron a rowing on the sea cattle on the meadow a charging with a roar endlinehere startlinehere quick and well escape them theyre as mad as they can be the wicket is the harbor and the garden is the shore endlinehere startlinehere the coach is at the door at last the eager children mounting fast and kissing hands in chorus sing good bye good bye to everything endlinehere startlinehere to house and garden field and lawn the meadow gates we swung upon to pump and stable tree and swing good bye good bye to everything endlinehere startlinehere and fare you well for evermore o ladder at the hayloft door o hayloft where the cobwebs cling good bye good bye to everything endlinehere startlinehere crack goes the whip and off we go the trees and houses smaller grow last round the woody turn we swing good bye good bye to everything endlinehere startlinehere when i was sick and lay a bed i had two pillows at my head and all my toys beside me lay to keep me happy all the day endlinehere startlinehere and sometimes for an hour or so i watched my leaden soldiers go with different uniforms and drills among the bed clothes through the hills endlinehere startlinehere and sometimes sent my ships in fleets all up and down among the sheets or brought my trees and houses out and planted cities all about endlinehere startlinehere i was the giant great and still that sits upon the pillow hill and sees before him dale and plain the pleasant land of counterpane endlinehere startlinehere come up here o dusty feet endlinehere startlinehere the lights from the parlor and kitchen shone out through the blinds and the windows and bars and high over head and all moving about there were thousands of millions of stars endlinehere startlinehere we built a ship upon the stairs all made of the back bedroom chairs and filled it full of sofa pillows to go a sailing on the billows endlinehere startlinehere we sailed along for days and days and had the very best of plays but tom fell out and hurt his knee so there was no one left but me endlinehere startlinehere bring the comb and play upon it endlinehere startlinehere marching here we come endlinehere startlinehere willie cocks his highland bonnet johnnie beats the drum endlinehere startlinehere mary jane commands the party peter leads the rear feet in time alert and hearty each a grenadier endlinehere startlinehere all in the most martial manner marching double quick while the napkin like a banner waves upon the stick endlinehere startlinehere heres enough of fame and pillage great commander jane endlinehere startlinehere now that weve been round the village lets go home again endlinehere startlinehere dark brown is the river golden is the sand endlinehere startlinehere it flows along for ever with trees on either hand endlinehere startlinehere green leaves a floating castles of the foam boats of mine a boating where will all come home endlinehere startlinehere on goes the river and out past the mill away down the valley away down the hill endlinehere startlinehere away down the river a hundred miles or more other little children shall bring my boats ashore endlinehere startlinehere through all the pleasant meadow side the grass grew shoulder high till the shining scythes went far and wide and cut it down to dry endlinehere startlinehere these green and sweetly smelling crops they led in wagons home and they piled them here in mountain tops for mountaineers to roam endlinehere startlinehere here is mount clear mount rusty nail mount eagle and mount high the mice that in these mountains dwell no happier are than i endlinehere startlinehere o what a joy to clamber there o what a place for play with the sweet the dim the dusty air the happy hills of hay endlinehere startlinehere whenever auntie moves around her dresses make a curious sound endlinehere startlinehere they trail behind her up the floor and trundle after through the door endlinehere startlinehere the friendly cow all red and white i love with all my heart she gives me cream with all her might to eat with apple tart endlinehere startlinehere she wanders lowing here and there and yet she cannot stray all in the pleasant open air the pleasant light of day endlinehere startlinehere and blown by all the winds that pass and wet with all the showers she walks among the meadow grass and eats the meadow flowers endlinehere startlinehere up into the cherry tree who should climb but little me endlinehere startlinehere i held the trunk with both my hands and looked abroad on foreign lands endlinehere startlinehere i saw the next door garden lie adorned with flowers before my eye and many pleasant places more that i had never seen before endlinehere startlinehere i saw the dimpling river pass and be the skys blue looking glass the dusty roads go up and down with people tramping into town endlinehere startlinehere if i could find a higher tree farther and farther i should see to where the grown up river slips into the sea among the ships endlinehere startlinehere to where the roads on either hand lead onward into fairy land where all the children dine at five and all the playthings come alive endlinehere startlinehere every night my prayers i say and get my dinner every day and every day that ive been good i get an orange after food endlinehere startlinehere the child that is not clean and neat with lots of toys and things to eat he is a naughty child im sure or else his dear papa is poor endlinehere startlinehere my holes were hollow like a cup in every hole the sea came up till it could hold no more endlinehere startlinehere all by myself i have to go with none to tell me what to do all alone beside the streams and up the mountain sides of dreams endlinehere startlinehere the strangest things are there for me both things to eat and things to see and many frightening sights abroad till morning in the land of nod endlinehere startlinehere try as i like to find the way i never can get back by day nor can remember plain and clear the curious music that i hear endlinehere startlinehere whenever the moon and stars are set whenever the wind is high all night long in the dark and wet a man goes riding by endlinehere startlinehere late in the night when the fires are out why does he gallop and gallop about endlinehere startlinehere whenever the trees are crying aloud and ships are tossed at sea by on the highway low and loud by at the gallop goes he endlinehere startlinehere by at the gallop he goes and then by he comes back at the gallop again endlinehere startlinehere a birdie with a yellow bill hopped up on the window sill cocked his shining eye and said aint you shamed you sleepy head endlinehere startlinehere the rain is raining all around endlinehere startlinehere it falls on field and tree it rains on the umbrellas here and on the ships at sea endlinehere startlinehere little indian sioux or crow little frosty eskimo little turk or japanee o endlinehere startlinehere dont you wish that you were me endlinehere startlinehere you have seen the scarlet trees and the lions over seas you have eaten ostrich eggs and turned the turtles off their legs endlinehere startlinehere such a life is very fine but its not so nice as mine you must often as you trod have wearied _not_ to be abroad endlinehere startlinehere you have curious things to eat i am fed on proper meat you must dwell beyond the foam but i am safe and live at home endlinehere startlinehere when i am grown to mans estate i shall be very proud and great and tell the other girls and boys not to meddle with my toys endlinehere startlinehere i have a little shadow that goes in and out with me and what can be the use of him is more than i can see endlinehere startlinehere he is very very like me from the heels up to the head and i see him jump before me when i jump into my bed endlinehere startlinehere he hasnt got a notion of how children ought to play and can only make a fool of me in every sort of way endlinehere startlinehere he stays so close beside me hes a coward you can see id think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me endlinehere startlinehere the sun is not a bed when i at night upon my pillow lie still round the earth his way he takes and morning after morning makes endlinehere startlinehere while here at home in shining day we round the sunny garden play each little indian sleepy head is being kissed and put to bed endlinehere startlinehere and when at eve i rise from tea day dawns beyond the atlantic sea and all the children in the west are getting up and being dressed endlinehere startlinehere smooth it slides upon its travel here a wimple there a gleam o the clean gravel endlinehere startlinehere o the smooth stream endlinehere startlinehere sailing blossoms silver fishes paven pools as clear as air how a child wishes to live down there endlinehere startlinehere see the rings pursue each other all below grows black as night just as if mother had blown out the light endlinehere startlinehere patience children just a minute see the spreading circles die the stream and all in it will clear by and by endlinehere startlinehere of speckled eggs the birdie sings and nests among the trees the sailor sings of ropes and things in ships upon the seas endlinehere startlinehere the children sing in far japan the children sing in spain the organ with the organ man is singing in the rain endlinehere startlinehere my bed is like a little boat nurse helps me in when i embark she girds me in my sailors coat and starts me in the dark endlinehere startlinehere at night i go on board and say good night to all my friends on shore i shut my eyes and sail away and see and hear no more endlinehere startlinehere and sometimes things to bed i take as prudent sailors have to do perhaps a slice of wedding cake perhaps a toy or two endlinehere startlinehere all night across the dark we steer but when the day returns at last safe in my room beside the pier i find my vessel fast endlinehere startlinehere over the borders a sin without pardon breaking the branches and crawling below out through the breach in the wall of the garden down by the banks of the river we go endlinehere startlinehere here is the mill with the humming of thunder here is the weir with the wonder of foam here is the sluice with the race running under marvelous places though handy to home endlinehere startlinehere years may go by and the wheel in the river wheel as it wheels for us children to day endlinehere startlinehere wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever long after all of the boys are away endlinehere startlinehere home from the indies and home from the ocean heroes and soldiers we all shall come home still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion turning and churning that river to foam endlinehere startlinehere you with the bean that i gave when we quarreled i with your marble of saturday last honored and old and all gaily apparelled here we shall meet and remember the past endlinehere startlinehere when children are playing alone on the green in comes the playmate that never was seen endlinehere startlinehere when children are happy and lonely and good the friend of the children comes out of the wood endlinehere startlinehere nobody heard him and nobody saw his is a picture you never could draw but hes sure to be present abroad or at home when children are happy and playing alone endlinehere startlinehere i saw you toss the kites on high and blow the birds about the sky and all around i heard you pass like ladies skirts across the grass o wind a blowing all day long endlinehere startlinehere o wind that sings so loud a song endlinehere startlinehere i saw the different things you did but always you yourself you hid endlinehere startlinehere i felt you push i heard you call i could not see yourself at all o wind a blowing all day long o wind that sings so loud a song endlinehere startlinehere o you that are so strong and cold o blower are you young or old endlinehere startlinehere are you a beast of field and tree or just a stronger child than me endlinehere startlinehere o wind a blowing all day long o wind that sings so loud a song endlinehere startlinehere i woke before the morning i was happy all the day i never said an ugly word but smiled and stuck to play endlinehere startlinehere and now at last the sun is going down behind the wood and i am very happy for i know that ive been good endlinehere startlinehere my bed is waiting cool and fresh with linen smooth and fair and i must off to sleepsin by and not forget my prayer endlinehere startlinehere i know that till to morrow i shall see the sun arise no ugly dream shall fright my mind no ugly sight my eyes endlinehere startlinehere but slumber hold me tightly till i waken in the dawn and hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn endlinehere startlinehere children you are very little and your bones are very brittle if you would grow great and stately you must try to walk sedately endlinehere startlinehere you must still be bright and quiet and content with simple diet and remain through all bewildring innocent and honest children endlinehere startlinehere happy hearts and happy faces happy play in grassy places that was how in ancient ages children grew to kings and sages endlinehere startlinehere but the unkind and the unruly and the sort who eat unduly they must never hope for glory theirs is quite a different story endlinehere startlinehere cruel children crying babies all grow up as geese and gabies hated as their age increases by their nephews and their nieces endlinehere startlinehere summer fading winter comes frosty mornings tingling thumbs window robins winter rooks and the picture story books endlinehere startlinehere water now is turned to stone nurse and i can walk upon still we find the flowing brooks in the picture story books endlinehere startlinehere all the pretty things put by wait upon the childrens eye sheep and shepherds trees and crooks in the picture story books endlinehere startlinehere we may see how all things are seas and cities near and far and the flying fairies looks in the picture story books endlinehere startlinehere how am i to sing your praise happy chimney corner days sitting safe in nursery nooks reading picture story books endlinehere startlinehere how do you like to go up in a swing up in the air so blue endlinehere startlinehere oh i do think it the pleasantest thing ever a child can do endlinehere startlinehere it is very nice to think the world is full of meat and drink with little children saying grace in every christian kind of place endlinehere startlinehere the lamps now glitter down the street faintly sound the falling feet and the blue even slowly falls about the garden trees and walls endlinehere startlinehere now in the falling of the gloom the red fire paints the empty room and warmly on the roof it looks and flickers on the backs of books endlinehere startlinehere armies march by tower and spire of cities blazing in the fire till as i gaze with staring eyes the armies fade the lustre dies endlinehere startlinehere then once again the glow returns again the phantom city burns and down the red hot valley lo endlinehere startlinehere the phantom armies marching go endlinehere startlinehere blinking embers tell me true where are those armies marching to and what the burning city is that crumbles in your furnaces endlinehere startlinehere down by a shining water well i found a very little dell no higher than my head endlinehere startlinehere the heather and the gorse about in summer bloom were coming out some yellow and some red endlinehere startlinehere i called the little pool a sea the little hills were big to me for i am very small endlinehere startlinehere i made a boat i made a town i searched the caverns up and down and named them one and all endlinehere startlinehere and all about was mine i said the little sparrows overhead the little minnows too endlinehere startlinehere this was the world and i was king for me the bees came by to sing for me the swallows flew endlinehere startlinehere i played there were no deeper seas nor any wider plains than these nor other kings than me endlinehere startlinehere at last i heard my mother call out from the house at evenfall to call me home to tea endlinehere startlinehere and i must rise and leave my dell and leave my dimpled water well and leave my heather blooms endlinehere startlinehere and as my home i neared how very big my nurse appeared how great and cool the rooms endlinehere startlinehere all round the house is the jet black night it stares through the window pane it crawls in the corners hiding from the light and it moves with the moving flame endlinehere startlinehere now my little heart goes a beating like a drum with the breath of bogie in my hair and all round the candle the crooked shadows come and go marching along up the stair endlinehere startlinehere the shadow of the balusters the shadow of the lamp the shadow of the child that goes to bed all the wicked shadows coming tramp tramp tramp with the black night overhead endlinehere startlinehere late lies the wintry sun a bed a frosty fiery sleepy head blinks but an hour or two and then a blood red orange sets again endlinehere startlinehere before the stars have left the skies at morning in the dark i rise and shivering in my nakedness by the cold candle bathe and dress endlinehere startlinehere close by the jolly fire i sit to warm my frozen bones a bit or with a reindeer sled explore the colder countries round the door endlinehere startlinehere when to go out my nurse doth wrap me in my comforter and cap the cold wind burns my face and blows its frosty pepper up my nose endlinehere startlinehere black are my steps on silver sod thick blows my frosty breath abroad and tree and house and hill and lake are frosted like a wedding cake endlinehere startlinehere i can in the sorrel sit where the ladybird alit endlinehere startlinehere i can climb the jointed grass and on high see the greater swallows pass in the sky and the round sun rolling by heeding no such things as i endlinehere startlinehere through that forest i can pass till as in a looking glass humming fly and daisy tree and my tiny self i see painted very clear and neat on the rain pool at my feet endlinehere startlinehere should a leaflet come to land drifting near to where i stand straight ill board that tiny boat round the rain pool sea to float endlinehere startlinehere little thoughtful creatures sit on the grassy coasts of it little things with lovely eyes see me sailing with surprise endlinehere startlinehere some are clad in armour green these have sure to battle been endlinehere startlinehere some are pied with evry hue black and crimson gold and blue some have wings and swift are gone but they all look kindly on endlinehere startlinehere last to the chamber where i lie my fearful footsteps patter nigh and come from out the cold and gloom into my warm and cheerful room endlinehere startlinehere there safe arrived we turn about to keep the coming shadows out and close the happy door at last on all the perils that we passed endlinehere startlinehere then when mamma goes by to bed she shall come in with tip toe tread and see me lying warm and fast and in the land of nod at last endlinehere startlinehere when the golden day is done through the closing portal child and garden flower and sun vanish all things mortal endlinehere startlinehere as the blinding showers fall as the rays diminish under evenings cloak they all roll away and vanish endlinehere startlinehere garden darkened daisy shut child in bed they slumber glow worm in the highway rut mice among the lumber endlinehere startlinehere in the darkness houses shine parents move with candles till on all the night divine turns the bedroom handles endlinehere startlinehere till at last the day begins in the east a breaking in the hedges and the whins sleeping birds a waking endlinehere startlinehere in the darkness shapes of things houses trees and hedges clearer grow and sparrows wings beat on window ledges endlinehere startlinehere these shall wake the yawning maid she the door shall open finding dew on garden glade and the morning broken endlinehere startlinehere there my garden grows again green and rosy painted as at eve behind the pane from my eyes it fainted endlinehere startlinehere just as it was shut away toy like in the even here i see it glow with day under glowing heaven endlinehere startlinehere every path and every plot every bush of roses every blue forget me not where the dew reposes endlinehere startlinehere they cry the day is come on the smiling valleys we have beat the morning drum playmate join your allies endlinehere startlinehere birds all the sunny day flutter and quarrel here in the arbor like tent of the laurel endlinehere startlinehere here in the fork the brown nest is seated four little blue eggs the mother keeps heated endlinehere startlinehere while we stand watching her staring like gabies safe in each egg are the birds little babies endlinehere startlinehere soon the frail eggs they shall chip and upspringing make all the april woods merry with singing endlinehere startlinehere younger than we are o children and frailer soon in blue air theyll be singer and sailor endlinehere startlinehere we so much older taller and stronger we shall look down on the birdies no longer endlinehere startlinehere they shall go flying with musical speeches high over head in the tops of the beeches endlinehere startlinehere in spite of our wisdom and sensible talking we on our feet must go plodding and walking endlinehere startlinehere all the names i know from nurse gardeners garters shepherds purse bachelors buttons ladys smock and the lady hollyhock endlinehere startlinehere fairy places fairy things fairy woods where the wild bee wings tiny trees for tiny dames these must all be fairy names endlinehere startlinehere tiny woods below whose boughs shady fairies weave a house tiny tree tops rose or thyme where the braver fairies climb endlinehere startlinehere fair are grown up peoples trees but the fairest woods are these where if i were not so tall i should live for good and all endlinehere startlinehere here is a child who clambers and scrambles all by himself and gathering brambles here is a tramp who stands and gazes and there is the green for stringing the daisies endlinehere startlinehere here is a cart run away in the road lumping along with man and load and here is a mill and there is a river each a glimpse and gone forever endlinehere startlinehere this whistle we made and how clearly it sounds endlinehere startlinehere by the side of a field at the end of the grounds endlinehere startlinehere of a branch of a plane with a knife of my own it was nursie who made it and nursie alone endlinehere startlinehere what are you able to build with your blocks endlinehere startlinehere castles and palaces temples and docks endlinehere startlinehere rain may keep raining and others go roam but i can be happy and building at home endlinehere startlinehere this one is sailing and that one is moored hark to the song of the sailors on board endlinehere startlinehere and see the steps of my palace the kings coming and going with presents and things endlinehere startlinehere now i have done with it down let it go endlinehere startlinehere all in a moment the town is laid low endlinehere startlinehere block upon block lying scattered and free what is there left of my town by the sea endlinehere startlinehere the gardener does not love to talk he makes me keep the gravel walk and when he puts his tools away he locks the door and takes the key endlinehere startlinehere away behind the currant row where no one else but cook may go far in the plots i see him dig old and serious brown and big endlinehere startlinehere he digs the flowers green red and blue nor wishes to be spoken to endlinehere startlinehere he digs the flowers and cuts the hay and never seems to want to play endlinehere startlinehere summer goes and winter comes with pinching toes when in the garden bare and brown you must lay your barrow down endlinehere startlinehere well now and while the summer stays to profit by these garden days o how much wiser you would be to play at indian wars with me endlinehere startlinehere heres peace for you and surety here the one wisdom the truth endlinehere startlinehere all day the good glad sun showers love and labour on you wine and song the greenwood laughs the wind blows all day long till night endlinehere startlinehere and night ends all things endlinehere startlinehere then shall be no lamp relumed in heaven no voices crying or changing lights or dreams and forms that hover endlinehere startlinehere and heart for all your sighing that gladness and those tears are over over endlinehere startlinehere and has the truth brought no new hope at all heart that youre weeping yet for paradise endlinehere startlinehere do they still whisper the old weary cries endlinehere startlinehere mid youth and song feasting and carnival through laughter through the roses as of old comes death on shadowy and relentless feet death unappeasable by prayer or gold death is the end the end endlinehere startlinehere proud then clear eyed and laughing go to greet death as a friend endlinehere startlinehere exile of immortality strongly wise strain through the dark with undesirous eyes to what may lie beyond it endlinehere startlinehere sets your star o heart for ever endlinehere startlinehere yet behind the night waits for the great unborn somewhere afar some white tremendous daybreak endlinehere startlinehere tenderly day that i have loved i close your eyes and smooth your quiet brow and fold your thin dead hands endlinehere startlinehere the grey veils of the half light deepen colour dies endlinehere startlinehere i bear you a light burden to the shrouded sands where lies your waiting boat by wreaths of the seas making mist garlanded with all grey weeds of the water crowned endlinehere startlinehere beyond the shifting cold twilight further than laughter goes or tears further than dreaming therell be no port no dawn lit islands endlinehere startlinehere but the drear waste darkening and at length flame ultimate on the deep endlinehere startlinehere oh the last fire and you unkissed unfriended there endlinehere startlinehere oh the lone ways red ending and we not there to weep endlinehere startlinehere we found you pale and quiet and strangely crowned with flowers lovely and secret as a child endlinehere startlinehere you came with us came happily hand in hand with the young dancing hours high on the downs at dawn endlinehere startlinehere void now and tenebrous the grey sands curve before me endlinehere startlinehere from the inland meadows fragrant of june and clover floats the dark and fills the hollow seas dead face with little creeping shadows and the white silence brims the hollow of the hills endlinehere startlinehere close in the nest is folded every weary wing hushed all the joyful voices and we who held you dear eastward we turn and homeward alone remembering endlinehere startlinehere day that i loved day that i loved the night is here endlinehere startlinehere i cower to the earth i waking i only endlinehere startlinehere high and cold thou dreamest o queen high dreaming and lonely endlinehere startlinehere and around me the feet of thy watchers tread endlinehere startlinehere there is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head an intolerable radiance of wings endlinehere startlinehere all the earth grows fire white lips of desire brushing cool on the forehead croon slumbrous things endlinehere startlinehere earth fades and the air is thrilled with ways dewy paths full of comfort endlinehere startlinehere from quiet skies in through the window my lord the sun endlinehere startlinehere and my eyes were dazzled and drunk with the misty gold the golden glory that drowned and crowned me eddied and swayed through the room endlinehere startlinehere around me to left and to right hunched figures and old dull blear eyed scribbling fools grew fair ringed round and haloed with holy light endlinehere startlinehere till the light faded and they were but fools again fools unknowing still scribbling blear eyed and stolid immortals endlinehere startlinehere id watched the sorrow of the evening sky and smelt the sea and earth and the warm clover and heard the waves and the seagulls mocking cry endlinehere startlinehere and in them all was only the old cry that song they always sing the best is over endlinehere startlinehere you may remember now and think and sigh o silly lover endlinehere startlinehere and i was tired and sick that all was over and because i for all my thinking never could recover one moment of the good hours that were over endlinehere startlinehere and i was sorry and sick and wished to die endlinehere startlinehere then from the sad west turning wearily i saw the pines against the white north sky very beautiful and still and bending over their sharp black heads against a quiet sky endlinehere startlinehere and there was peace in them and i was happy and forgot to play the lover and laughed and did no longer wish to die being glad of you o pine trees and the sky endlinehere startlinehere creeps in half wanton half asleep one with a fat wide hairless face endlinehere startlinehere he likes love music that is cheap likes women in a crowded place and wants to hear the noise theyre making endlinehere startlinehere his heavy eyelids droop half over great pouches swing beneath his eyes endlinehere startlinehere he listens thinks himself the lover heaves from his stomach wheezy sighs he likes to feel his hearts a breaking endlinehere startlinehere his little lips are bright with slime endlinehere startlinehere the music swells endlinehere startlinehere the women shiver endlinehere startlinehere and all the while in perfect time his pendulous stomach hangs a shaking endlinehere startlinehere all the shade is rife with magic and movement endlinehere startlinehere i stray alone here on the edge of silence half afraid waiting a sign endlinehere startlinehere in the deep heart of me the sullen waters swell towards the moon and all my tides set seaward endlinehere startlinehere from inland leaps a gay fragment of some mocking tune that tinkles and laughs and fades along the sand and dies between the seawall and the sea endlinehere startlinehere song of a tribe of the ancient egyptians the priests within the temple she was wrinkled and huge and hideous endlinehere startlinehere she was our mother endlinehere startlinehere she was lustful and lewd endlinehere startlinehere but a god we had none other endlinehere startlinehere in the day she was hidden and dumb but at nightfall moaned in the shade we shuddered and gave her her will in the darkness we were afraid endlinehere startlinehere the people without she sent us pain and we bowed before her she smiled again and bade us adore her endlinehere startlinehere she solaced our woe and soothed our sighing and what shall we do now god is dying endlinehere startlinehere the priests within she was hungry and ate our children how should we stay her endlinehere startlinehere she took our young men and our maidens ours to obey her endlinehere startlinehere we were loathed and mocked and reviled of all nations that was our pride endlinehere startlinehere she fed us protected us loved us and killed us now she has died endlinehere startlinehere the people without she was so strong but death is stronger endlinehere startlinehere she ruled us long but time is longer endlinehere startlinehere halted around the fire by night after moon set they sing this beneath the trees endlinehere startlinehere what light of unremembered skies hast thou relumed within our eyes thou whom we seek whom we shall find endlinehere startlinehere a certain odour on the wind thy hidden face beyond the west these things have called us on a quest older than any road we trod more endless than desire endlinehere startlinehere far god sigh with thy cruel voice that fills the soul with longing for dim hills and faint horizons endlinehere startlinehere for there come grey moments of the antient dumb sickness of travel when no song can cheer us but the way seems long and one remembers endlinehere startlinehere the beat of weary unreturning feet and songs of pilgrims unreturning endlinehere startlinehere the fires we left are always burning on the old shrines of home endlinehere startlinehere our kin have built them temples and therein pray to the gods we know and dwell in little houses lovable being happy we remember how endlinehere startlinehere and peaceful even to death endlinehere startlinehere o thou god of all long desirous roaming our hearts are sick of fruitless homing and crying after lost desire endlinehere startlinehere as with fire consuming dreams of other bliss endlinehere startlinehere sung on one night in the cities in the darkness endlinehere startlinehere ye are sober and dull through the common day but now it is night endlinehere startlinehere it is shameful night and god is asleep endlinehere startlinehere have you not felt the quick fires that creep through the hungry flesh and the lust of delight and hot secrets of dreams that day cannot say endlinehere startlinehere the house is dumb the night calls out to you endlinehere startlinehere down the dim stairs through the creaking door naked crawling on hands and feet it is meet endlinehere startlinehere ye are men no longer but less and more beast and god endlinehere startlinehere down the lampless street by little black ways and secret places in the darkness and mire faint laughter around and evil faces by the star glint seen ah endlinehere startlinehere for the darkness whispers a blind desire and the fingers of night are amorous endlinehere startlinehere because god put his adamantine fate between my sullen heart and its desire i swore that i would burst the iron gate rise up and curse him on his throne of fire endlinehere startlinehere an idle wind blew round an empty throne and stirred the heavy curtains on the walls endlinehere startlinehere before thy shrine i kneel an unknown worshipper chanting strange hymns to thee and sorrowful litanies incense of dirges prayers that are as holy myrrh endlinehere startlinehere ah goddess on thy throne of tears and faint low sighs weary at last to theeward come the feet that err and empty hearts grown tired of the worlds vanities endlinehere startlinehere how fair this cool deep silence to a wanderer deaf with the roar of winds along the open skies endlinehere startlinehere sweet after sting and bitter kiss of sea water the pale lethean wine within thy chalices endlinehere startlinehere from the train between bologna and milan second class endlinehere startlinehere opposite me two germans snore and sweat endlinehere startlinehere through sullen swirling gloom we jolt and roar endlinehere startlinehere we have been here for ever even yet a dim watch tells two hours two aeons more endlinehere startlinehere the windows are tight shut and slimy wet with a nights foetor endlinehere startlinehere there are two hours more two hours to dawn and milan two hours yet endlinehere startlinehere opposite me two germans sweat and snore endlinehere startlinehere one of them wakes and spits and sleeps again endlinehere startlinehere the darkness shivers endlinehere startlinehere a wan light through the rain strikes on our faces drawn and white endlinehere startlinehere somewhere a new day sprawls and inside the foul air is chill and damp and fouler than before endlinehere startlinehere out of the nothingness of sleep the slow dreams of eternity there was a thunder on the deep i came because you called to me endlinehere startlinehere i broke the nights primeval bars i dared the old abysmal curse and flashed through ranks of frightened stars suddenly on the universe endlinehere startlinehere the eternal silences were broken hell became heaven as i passed endlinehere startlinehere what shall i give you as a token a sign that we have met at last endlinehere startlinehere ill break and forge the stars anew shatter the heavens with a song immortal in my love for you because i love you very strong endlinehere startlinehere then only in the empty spaces death walking very silently shall fear the glory of our faces through all the dark infinity endlinehere startlinehere so clothed about with perfect love the eternal end shall find us one alone above the night above the dust of the dead gods alone endlinehere startlinehere we leave this resting place made fair by one another for a while endlinehere startlinehere now for a god speed one last mad embrace the long road then unlit by your faint smile endlinehere startlinehere and you so far away endlinehere startlinehere oh ill remember endlinehere startlinehere each crawling day will pale a little your scarlet lips each mile dull the dear pain of your remembered face endlinehere startlinehere some day i shall rise and leave my friends and seek you again through the worlds far ends you whom i found so fair touch of your hands and smell of your hair endlinehere startlinehere my only god in the days that were endlinehere startlinehere my eager feet shall find you again though the sullen years and the mark of pain have changed you wholly for i shall know how could i forget having loved you so endlinehere startlinehere in the sad half light of evening the face that was all my sunrising endlinehere startlinehere and i loved you before you were old and wise when the flame of youth was strong in your eyes and my heart is sick with memories endlinehere startlinehere death will find me long before i tire of watching you and swing me suddenly into the shade and loneliness and mire of the last land endlinehere startlinehere there waiting patiently one day i think ill feel a cool wind blowing see a slow light across the stygian tide and hear the dead about me stir unknowing and tremble endlinehere startlinehere and turn and toss your brown delightful head amusedly among the ancient dead endlinehere startlinehere i said i splendidly loved you its not true endlinehere startlinehere such long swift tides stir not a land locked sea endlinehere startlinehere on gods or fools the high risk falls on you the clean clear bitter sweet thats not for me endlinehere startlinehere love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist endlinehere startlinehere love is flung lucifer like from heaven to hell endlinehere startlinehere pleasures not theirs nor pain endlinehere startlinehere they doubt and sigh and do not love at all endlinehere startlinehere of these am i endlinehere startlinehere or that foul you endlinehere startlinehere but this the strange gods who had given so much to have seen and known you this they might not do endlinehere startlinehere one last shames spared me one black words unspoken and im alone and you have not awoken endlinehere startlinehere one moment what it is to love endlinehere startlinehere and yet the best that eithers known will change and wither and be less at last than comfort or its own remembrance endlinehere startlinehere and when some caress tendered in habit once a flame all heaven sang out to wakes the shame unworded in the steady eyes well have that day what shall we do endlinehere startlinehere being so noble kill the two whove reached their second best endlinehere startlinehere being wise break cleanly off and get away endlinehere startlinehere follow down other windier skies new lures alone endlinehere startlinehere or shall we stay since this is all weve known content in the lean twilight of such day and not remember not lament endlinehere startlinehere so i from paint stone tale and rhyme stuffed loves infinity and sucked all lovers of all time to rarify ecstasy endlinehere startlinehere helens the hair shuts out from me veronas livid skies gypsy the lips i press and see two antonys in your eyes endlinehere startlinehere in a cool curving world he lies and ripples with dark ecstasies endlinehere startlinehere there slipping wave and shore are one and weed and mud endlinehere startlinehere and alls one endlinehere startlinehere gentle embracing quiet dun the world he rests in world he knows perpetual curving endlinehere startlinehere space is no more under the mud his bliss is older than the sun endlinehere startlinehere silent and straight the waters run endlinehere startlinehere the lights the cries the willows dim and the dark tide are one with him endlinehere startlinehere how can we find endlinehere startlinehere how can we rest endlinehere startlinehere how can we being gods win joy or peace being man endlinehere startlinehere loves for completeness endlinehere startlinehere no perfection grows twixt leg and arm elbow and ear and nose and joint and socket but unsatisfied sprawling desires shapeless perverse denied endlinehere startlinehere how can love triumph how can solace be where fever turns toward fever knee toward knee endlinehere startlinehere and i went on endlinehere startlinehere for if my echoing footfall slept soon a far whispering thered be of a little lonely wind that crept from tree to tree and distantly followed me followed me endlinehere startlinehere but the blue vaporous end of day brought peace and pursuit baffled quite where between pine woods dipped the way endlinehere startlinehere i turned slipped in and out of sight endlinehere startlinehere i trod as quiet as the night endlinehere startlinehere the pine boles kept perpetual hush and in the boughs wind never swirled endlinehere startlinehere i found a flowering lowly bush and bowed slid in and sighed and curled hidden at rest from all the world endlinehere startlinehere i was safe and glad i knew endlinehere startlinehere yet with cold heart and cold wet brows i lay endlinehere startlinehere and the dark fell endlinehere startlinehere there grew meward a sound of shaken boughs and ceased above my intricate house and silence silence silence found me endlinehere startlinehere i felt the unfaltering movement creep among the leaves endlinehere startlinehere they shed around me calm clouds of scent that i did weep and stroked my face endlinehere startlinehere i fell asleep endlinehere startlinehere breathless we flung us on the windy hill laughed in the sun and kissed the lovely grass endlinehere startlinehere you said through glory and ecstasy we pass wind sun and earth remain the birds sing still when we are old are old endlinehere startlinehere and when we die alls over that is ours and life burns on through other lovers other lips said i heart of my heart our heaven is now is won endlinehere startlinehere we are earths best that learnt her lesson here endlinehere startlinehere life is our cry endlinehere startlinehere we have kept the faith endlinehere startlinehere we said we shall go down with unreluctant tread rose crowned into the darkness endlinehere startlinehere proud we were and laughed that had such brave true things to say endlinehere startlinehere and then you suddenly cried and turned away endlinehere startlinehere i dreamt i was in love again with the one before the last and smiled to greet the pleasant pain of that innocent young past endlinehere startlinehere but i jumped to feel how sharp had been the pain when it did live how the faded dreams of nineteen ten were hell in nineteen five endlinehere startlinehere the boys woe was as keen and clear the boys love just as true and the one before the last my dear hurt quite as much as you endlinehere startlinehere sickly i pondered how the lover wrongs the unanswering tomb and sentimentalizes over what earned a better doom endlinehere startlinehere gently he tombs the poor dim last time strews pinkish dust above and sighs the dear dead boyish pastime endlinehere startlinehere but this ah god endlinehere startlinehere better oblivion hide dead true loves better the night enfold than men to eke the praise of new loves should lie about the old endlinehere startlinehere bitter thoughts i had in plenty endlinehere startlinehere but heres the worst of it i shall forget in nineteen twenty you ever hurt abit endlinehere startlinehere the stars a jolly company i envied straying late and lonely and cried upon their revelry o white companionship endlinehere startlinehere you only in love in faith unbroken dwell friends radiant and inseparable endlinehere startlinehere but i remembering pitied well and loved them who with lonely light in empty infinite spaces dwell disconsolate endlinehere startlinehere for all the night i heard the thin gnat voices cry star to faint star across the sky endlinehere startlinehere he wakes who never thought to wake again who held the end was death endlinehere startlinehere he opens eyes slowly to one long livid oozing plain closed down by the strange eyeless heavens endlinehere startlinehere he lies and waits and once in timeless sick surmise through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand like a dry branch endlinehere startlinehere i thought when love for you died i should die endlinehere startlinehere alone most strangely i live on endlinehere startlinehere was called ambarvalia swings the way still by hollow and hill and all the worlds a song shes far it sings me but fair it rings me quiet it laughs and strong endlinehere startlinehere spite of the miles and years between us spite of your chosen part i do remember and i go with laughter in my heart endlinehere startlinehere so above the little folk that know not out of the white hill town high up i clamber and i remember and watch the day go down endlinehere startlinehere theyll call the news from hill to hill dark and uncomforted earth and sky and the winds and i shall know that you are dead endlinehere startlinehere i shall not hear your trentals nor eat your arval bread for the kin of you will surely do their duty by the dead endlinehere startlinehere their little dull greasy eyes will water theyll paw you and gulp afresh endlinehere startlinehere theyll sniffle and weep and their thoughts will creep like flies on the cold flesh endlinehere startlinehere they will put pence on your grey eyes bind up your fallen chin and lay you straight the fools that loved you because they were your kin endlinehere startlinehere they will praise all the bad about you and hush the good away and wonder how theyll do without you and then theyll go away endlinehere startlinehere with snuffle and sniff and handkerchief and dim and decorous mirth with ham and sherry theyll meet to bury the lordliest lass of earth endlinehere startlinehere the little dead hearts will tramp ungrieving behind lone riding you the heart so high the heart so living heart that they never knew endlinehere startlinehere i shall not hear your trentals nor eat your arval bread nor with smug breath tell lies of death to the unanswering dead endlinehere startlinehere with snuffle and sniff and handkerchief the folk who loved you not will bury you and go wondering back home endlinehere startlinehere and you will rot endlinehere startlinehere but laughing and half way up to heaven with wind and hill and star i yet shall keep before i sleep your ambarvalia endlinehere startlinehere there was a damned successful poet there was a woman like the sun endlinehere startlinehere and they were dead endlinehere startlinehere they did not know it endlinehere startlinehere they did not know their time was done endlinehere startlinehere they did not know his hymns were silence and her limbs that had served love so well dust and a filthy smell endlinehere startlinehere so knee to knee they sped again and laugh to laugh they ran im told across the streets of hell endlinehere startlinehere and then they suddenly felt the wind blow cold and knew so closely pressed chill air on lip and breast and with a sick surprise the emptiness of eyes endlinehere startlinehere here where loves stuff is body arm and side are stabbing sweet gainst chair and lamp and wall endlinehere startlinehere in every touch more intimate meanings hide and flaming brains are the white heart of all endlinehere startlinehere here million pulses to one centre beat closed in by mens vast friendliness alone two can be drunk with solitude and meet on the sheer point where sense with knowings one endlinehere startlinehere though the woods are quiet and youve heard night creep along the hedges endlinehere startlinehere never go where tangled foliage shrouds the crying bird and the remote winds sigh and waters flow endlinehere startlinehere for moveless limbs no pity i crave that never were swift endlinehere startlinehere still all i prize laughter and thought and friends i have no fool to heave luxurious sighs for the woods and hills that i never knew endlinehere startlinehere the more excellent ways yet mine endlinehere startlinehere and you flower laden come to the clean white cell and we talk as ever am i not the same endlinehere startlinehere with our hearts we love immutable you without pity i without shame endlinehere startlinehere we talk as of old as of old you go out under the sky and laughing i know flit through the streets your heart all me till you gain the world beyond the town endlinehere startlinehere then i fade from your heart quietly and your fleet steps quicken endlinehere startlinehere the strong down smiles you welcome there the woods that love you close lovely and conquering arms above you endlinehere startlinehere o ever moving o lithe and free endlinehere startlinehere fast in my linen prison i press on impassable bars or emptily laugh in my great loneliness endlinehere startlinehere and still in the white neat bed i strive most impotently against that gyve being less now than a thought even to you alone with your hills and heaven endlinehere startlinehere i hot through troys ruin menelaus broke to priams palace sword in hand to sate on that adulterous whore a ten years hate and a kings honour endlinehere startlinehere through red death and smoke and cries and then by quieter ways he strode till the still innermost chamber fronted him endlinehere startlinehere he swung his sword and crashed into the dim luxurious bower flaming like a god endlinehere startlinehere high sat white helen lonely and serene endlinehere startlinehere he had not remembered that she was so fair and that her neck curved down in such a way and he felt tired endlinehere startlinehere he flung the sword away and kissed her feet and knelt before her there the perfect knight before the perfect queen endlinehere startlinehere ii so far the poet endlinehere startlinehere how should he behold that journey home the long connubial years endlinehere startlinehere he does not tell you how white helen bears child on legitimate child becomes a scold haggard with virtue endlinehere startlinehere menelaus bold waxed garrulous and sacked a hundred troys twixt noon and supper endlinehere startlinehere and her golden voice got shrill as he grew deafer endlinehere startlinehere and both were old endlinehere startlinehere often he wonders why on earth he went troyward or why poor paris ever came endlinehere startlinehere oft she weeps gummy eyed and impotent her dry shanks twitch at paris mumbled name endlinehere startlinehere so menelaus nagged and helen cried and paris slept on by scamander side endlinehere startlinehere how should i know endlinehere startlinehere the enormous wheels of will drove me cold eyed on tired and sleepless feet endlinehere startlinehere night was void arms and you a phantom still and day your far light swaying down the street endlinehere startlinehere as never fool for love i starved for you my throat was dry and my eyes hot to see endlinehere startlinehere your mouth so lying was most heaven in view and your remembered smell most agony endlinehere startlinehere i felt your hot wrist shiver and suddenly the mad victory i planned flashed real in your burning bending head endlinehere startlinehere my conquerors blood was cool as a deep river in shadow and my heart beneath your hand quieter than a dead man on a bed endlinehere startlinehere day after day youll sit with him and note the greasier tie the dingy wrinkling coat as prettiness turns to pomp and strength to fat and love love love to habit endlinehere startlinehere o lithe and free and lightfoot that the poor heart cries to see thats how ill see your man and you endlinehere startlinehere but you oh when that time comes youll be dirty too endlinehere startlinehere my restless blood now lies a quiver knowing that always exquisitely this april twilight on the river stirs anguish in the heart of me endlinehere startlinehere and all these like a waiting lover murmur and gleam lift lustrous eyes drift close to me and sideways bending whisper delicious words endlinehere startlinehere but i stretch terrible hands uncomprehending shaken with love and laugh and cry endlinehere startlinehere and hatred followed after shrilling madly down the breeze endlinehere startlinehere in peace from the wild heart of clamour a flower in moonlight she was there was rippling down white ways of glamour quietly laid on wave and air endlinehere startlinehere her passing left no leaf a quiver endlinehere startlinehere pale flowers wreathed her white white brows endlinehere startlinehere her feet were silence on the river and hush endlinehere startlinehere she said between the boughs endlinehere startlinehere in darkness the loud sea makes moan and earth is shaken and all evils creep about her ways endlinehere startlinehere oh now to know you sleep endlinehere startlinehere your magic and your beauty and your strength like hills at noon or sunlight on a tree sleeping prevail in earth and air endlinehere startlinehere in the sweet gloom above the brown and white night benedictions hover and the winds of night move gently round the room and watch you there endlinehere startlinehere and still the darkness ebbs about your bed endlinehere startlinehere quiet and strange and loving kind you sleep endlinehere startlinehere and holy joy about the earth is shed and holiness upon the deep endlinehere startlinehere from the candles and dumb shadows and the house where love had died i stole to the vast moonlight and the whispering life outside endlinehere startlinehere but i found no lips of comfort no home in the moons light i little and lone and frightened in the unfriendly night and no meaning in the voices endlinehere startlinehere far over the lands and through the dark beyond the ocean i willed to think of you endlinehere startlinehere for i knew had you been with me id have known the words of night found peace of heart gone gladly in comfort of that light endlinehere startlinehere but ever desperately i willed till all grew soft and far and silent endlinehere startlinehere and suddenly i found you white and radiant sleeping quietly far out through the tides of darkness endlinehere startlinehere love they said is king of kings and triumph is his crown endlinehere startlinehere earth fades in flame before his wings and sun and moon bow down endlinehere startlinehere but that i knew would never do and heaven is all too high endlinehere startlinehere so whenever i meet a queen i said i will not catch her eye endlinehere startlinehere love they said and love they said the gift of love is this a crown of thorns about thy head and vinegar to thy kiss endlinehere startlinehere but tragedy is not for me and im content to be gay endlinehere startlinehere so whenever i spied a tragic lady i went another way endlinehere startlinehere and so i never feared to see you wander down the street or come across the fields to me on ordinary feet endlinehere startlinehere for what theyd never told me of and what i never knew it was that all the time my love love would be merely you endlinehere startlinehere safe in the magic of my woods i lay and watched the dying light endlinehere startlinehere faint in the pale high solitudes and washed with rain and veiled by night silver and blue and green were showing endlinehere startlinehere the spell was broken the key denied me and at length your flat clear voice beside me mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes endlinehere startlinehere you came and quacked beside me in the wood endlinehere startlinehere you said the view from here is very good endlinehere startlinehere you said its nice to be alone a bit endlinehere startlinehere and how the days are drawing out endlinehere startlinehere you said the sunsets pretty isnt it endlinehere startlinehere i wish i wish that you were dead endlinehere startlinehere lip and eye flashed on the glory shone and cried improvident unmemoried and fitfully and like a flame the light of laughter went and came endlinehere startlinehere proud in their careless transience moved the changing faces that i loved endlinehere startlinehere till suddenly and otherwhence i looked upon your innocence endlinehere startlinehere for lifted clear and still and strange from the dark woven flow of change under a vast and starless sky i saw the immortal moment lie endlinehere startlinehere one instant i an instant knew as god knows all endlinehere startlinehere and it and you i above time oh blind endlinehere startlinehere could see in witless immortality endlinehere startlinehere i saw the marble cup the tea hung on the air an amber stream i saw the fires unglittering gleam the painted flame the frozen smoke endlinehere startlinehere light was more alive than you endlinehere startlinehere for suddenly and otherwhence i looked on your magnificence endlinehere startlinehere dazed at length human eyes grew mortal strength wearied and time began to creep endlinehere startlinehere change closed about me like a sleep endlinehere startlinehere light glinted on the eyes i loved endlinehere startlinehere the cup was filled endlinehere startlinehere the bodies moved endlinehere startlinehere the drifting petal came to ground endlinehere startlinehere the laughter chimed its perfect round endlinehere startlinehere the broken syllable was ended endlinehere startlinehere and i so certain and so friended how could i cloud or how distress the heaven of your unconsciousness endlinehere startlinehere or shake at times sufficient spell stammering of lights unutterable endlinehere startlinehere the eternal holiness of you the timeless end you never knew the peace that lay the light that shone endlinehere startlinehere you never knew that i had gone a million miles away and stayed a million years endlinehere startlinehere the laughter played unbroken round me and the jest flashed on endlinehere startlinehere and we that knew the best down wonderful hours grew happier yet endlinehere startlinehere i sang at heart and talked and eat and lived from laugh to laugh i too when you were there and you and you endlinehere startlinehere in a flowered dell the lady venus stood amazed with sorrow endlinehere startlinehere down the morning one far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun rang out and held and died endlinehere startlinehere she thought the wood grew quieter endlinehere startlinehere wing and leaf and pool of light forgot to dance endlinehere startlinehere dumb lay the unfalling stream life one eternal instant rose in dream clear out of time poised on a golden height endlinehere startlinehere till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour endlinehere startlinehere the gold waves purled amidst the green above her and a bird sang endlinehere startlinehere with one sharp taken breath by sunlit branches and unshaken flower the immortal limbs flashed to the human lover and the immortal eyes to look on death endlinehere startlinehere the damned ship lurched and slithered endlinehere startlinehere quiet and quick my cold gorge rose the long sea rolled i knew i must think hard of something or be sick and could think hard of only one thing you endlinehere startlinehere you you alone could hold my fancy ever endlinehere startlinehere and with you memories come sharp pain and dole endlinehere startlinehere now theres a choice heartache or tortured liver endlinehere startlinehere a sea sick body or a you sick soul endlinehere startlinehere do i forget you endlinehere startlinehere retchings twist and tie me old meat good meals brown gobbets up i throw endlinehere startlinehere acrid return and slimy the sobs and slobber of a last years woe endlinehere startlinehere and still the sick ship rolls endlinehere startlinehere tis hard i tell ye to choose twixt love and nausea heart and belly endlinehere startlinehere all night the ways of heaven were desolate long roads across a gleaming empty sky endlinehere startlinehere outcast and doomed and driven you and i alone serene beyond all love or hate terror or triumph were content to wait we silent and all knowing endlinehere startlinehere suddenly swept through the heaven low crouching from on high one horseman downward to the earths low gate endlinehere startlinehere oh perfect from the ultimate height of living lightly we turned through wet woods blossom hung into the open endlinehere startlinehere down the supernal roads with plumes a tossing purple flags far flung rank upon rank unbridled unforgiving thundered the black battalions of the gods endlinehere startlinehere through my hearts palace thoughts unnumbered throng and there most quiet and as a child most wise high throned you sit and gracious endlinehere startlinehere all day long great hopes gold armoured jester fantasies and pilgrim dreams and little beggar sighs bow to your benediction go their way endlinehere startlinehere and the grave jewelled courtier memories worship and love and tend you all the day endlinehere startlinehere not now when desire burns and the wind calls and the suns of spring light foot dance in the woods whisper of life woo me to wayfaring ah endlinehere startlinehere not now should you come now when the road beckons and good friends call where are songs to be sung fights to be fought yea endlinehere startlinehere and the best of all love on myriad lips fairer than yours kisses you could not give endlinehere startlinehere dearest why should i mourn whimper and whine i that have yet to live endlinehere startlinehere sorrow will i forget tears for the best love on the lips of you now when dawn in the blood wakes and the sun laughs up the eastern blue ill forget and be glad endlinehere startlinehere still i abode strong in a golden dream unrecaptured endlinehere startlinehere and in the heart of it end of labouring you endlinehere startlinehere therefore i kept ready the altar lit the flame burning apart endlinehere startlinehere face of my dreams vainly in vision white gleaming down to me lo endlinehere startlinehere for about midnight whispers grew through the wood suddenly strange cries in the boughs above grated cries like a laugh endlinehere startlinehere silent and black then through the sacred grove great birds flew as a dream troubling the leaves passing at length endlinehere startlinehere therefore i go never to rest or win peace and worship of you more and the dumb wood and the shrine therein endlinehere startlinehere so light we were so right we were so fair faith shone and the way was laid so certainly that when id gone what dumb thing looked up at you endlinehere startlinehere was it something heard or a sudden cry that meekly and without a word you broke the faith and strangely weakly slipped apart endlinehere startlinehere you gave in you the proud of heart unbowed of heart endlinehere startlinehere was this friend the end of all that we could do endlinehere startlinehere and have you found the best for you the rest for you endlinehere startlinehere did you learn so suddenly and i not by endlinehere startlinehere some whispered story that stole the glory from the sky and ended all the splendid dream and made you go so dully from the fight we know the light we know endlinehere startlinehere the faith remains and i must pass gay down the way and on alone endlinehere startlinehere under the grass you wait the breeze moves in the trees and stirs and calls and covers you with white petals with light petals endlinehere startlinehere good sleep to you endlinehere startlinehere we have built a house that is not for times throwing endlinehere startlinehere we have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever endlinehere startlinehere war knows no power endlinehere startlinehere safe shall be my going secretly armed against all deaths endeavour safe though all safetys lost safe where men fall and if these poor limbs die safest of all endlinehere startlinehere blow out you bugles over the rich dead endlinehere startlinehere theres none of these so lonely and poor of old but dying has made us rarer gifts than gold endlinehere startlinehere blow bugles blow endlinehere startlinehere they brought us for our dearth holiness lacked so long and love and pain endlinehere startlinehere honour has come back as a king to earth and paid his subjects with a royal wage and nobleness walks in our ways again and we have come into our heritage endlinehere startlinehere these hearts were woven of human joys and cares washed marvellously with sorrow swift to mirth endlinehere startlinehere the years had given them kindness endlinehere startlinehere dawn was theirs and sunset and the colours of the earth endlinehere startlinehere these had seen movement and heard music known slumber and waking loved gone proudly friended felt the quick stir of wonder sat alone touched flowers and furs and cheeks endlinehere startlinehere all this is ended endlinehere startlinehere there are waters blown by changing winds to laughter and lit by the rich skies all day endlinehere startlinehere and after frost with a gesture stays the waves that dance and wandering loveliness endlinehere startlinehere he leaves a white unbroken glory a gathered radiance a width a shining peace under the night endlinehere startlinehere if i should die think only this of me that theres some corner of a foreign field that is for ever england endlinehere startlinehere mamua when our laughter ends and hearts and bodies brown as white are dust about the doors of friends or scent ablowing down the night then oh endlinehere startlinehere then the wise agree comes our immortality endlinehere startlinehere mamua there waits a land hard for us to understand endlinehere startlinehere out of time beyond the sun all are one in paradise you and pupure are one and tau and the ungainly wise endlinehere startlinehere and my laughter and my pain shall home to the eternal brain endlinehere startlinehere and therell no more be one who dreams under the ferns of crumbling stuff eyes of illusion mouth that seems all time entangled human love endlinehere startlinehere and youll no longer swing and sway divinely down the scented shade where feet to ambulation fade and moons are lost in endless day endlinehere startlinehere how shall we wind these wreaths of ours where there are neither heads nor flowers endlinehere startlinehere but well be missing the palms and sunlight and the south and theres an end i think of kissing when our mouths are one with mouth endlinehere startlinehere tau here mamua crown the hair and come away endlinehere startlinehere hear the calling of the moon and the whispering scents that stray about the idle warm lagoon endlinehere startlinehere hasten hand in human hand down the dark the flowered way along the whiteness of the sand and in the waters soft caress wash the mind of foolishness mamua until the day endlinehere startlinehere spend the glittering moonlight there pursuing down the soundless deep limbs that gleam and shadowy hair or floating lazy half asleep endlinehere startlinehere dive and double and follow after snare in flowers and kiss and call with lips that fade and human laughter and faces individual well this side of paradise endlinehere startlinehere theres little comfort in the wise endlinehere startlinehere love in you went passing by penetrative remote and rare like a bird in the wide air and as the bird it left no trace in the heaven of your face endlinehere startlinehere in your stupidity i found the sweet hush after a sweet sound endlinehere startlinehere all about you was the light that dims the greying end of night desire was the unrisen sun joy the day not yet begun with tree whispering to tree without wind quietly endlinehere startlinehere wisdom slept within your hair and long suffering was there and in the flowing of your dress undiscerning tenderness endlinehere startlinehere and when you thought it seemed to me infinitely and like a sea about the slight world you had known your vast unconsciousness was thrown endlinehere startlinehere o haven without wave or tide endlinehere startlinehere silence in which all songs have died endlinehere startlinehere holy book where hearts are still endlinehere startlinehere and home at length under the hill endlinehere startlinehere o mother quiet breasts of peace where love itself would faint and cease endlinehere startlinehere now ere the unthinking silence on that strife steals down i would cheat drowsy death so far my night shall be remembered for a star that outshone all the suns of all mens days endlinehere startlinehere shall i not crown them with immortal praise whom i have loved who have given me dared with me high secrets and in darkness knelt to see the inenarrable godhead of delight endlinehere startlinehere love is a flame we have beaconed the worlds night endlinehere startlinehere a city and we have built it these and i endlinehere startlinehere an emperor we have taught the world to die endlinehere startlinehere dear names and thousand other throng to me endlinehere startlinehere and these shall pass whatever passes not in the great hour nor all my passion all my prayers have power to hold them with me through the gate of death endlinehere startlinehere theyll play deserter turn with the traitor breath break the high bond we made and sell loves trust and sacramented covenant to the dust endlinehere startlinehere but the best ive known stays here and changes breaks grows old is blown about the winds of the world and fades from brains of living men and dies endlinehere startlinehere o dear my loves o faithless once again this one last gift i give that after men shall know and later lovers far removed praise you all these were lovely say he loved endlinehere startlinehere mataiea fish fly replete in depth of june dawdling away their watry noon ponder deep wisdom dark or clear each secret fishy hope or fear endlinehere startlinehere fish say they have their stream and pond but is there anything beyond endlinehere startlinehere this life cannot be all they swear for how unpleasant if it were endlinehere startlinehere one may not doubt that somehow good shall come of water and of mud and sure the reverent eye must see a purpose in liquidity endlinehere startlinehere we darkly know by faith we cry the future is not wholly dry endlinehere startlinehere mud unto mud endlinehere startlinehere death eddies near not here the appointed end not here endlinehere startlinehere but somewhere beyond space and time endlinehere startlinehere is wetter water slimier slime endlinehere startlinehere and there they trust there swimmeth one who swam ere rivers were begun immense of fishy form and mind squamous omnipotent and kind and under that almighty fin the littlest fish may enter in endlinehere startlinehere and in that heaven of all their wish there shall be no more land say fish endlinehere startlinehere this i know and yet i know doubts that will not be denied endlinehere startlinehere for if the soul be not in place what has laid trouble in her face endlinehere startlinehere and if the spirit be not there why is fragrance in the hair endlinehere startlinehere oh love is fair and love is rare my dear one she said but love goes lightly over endlinehere startlinehere i bowed her foolish head and kissed her hair and laughed at her endlinehere startlinehere such a child was she so new to love so true to love and she spoke so bitterly endlinehere startlinehere i have peace to weigh your worth now all is over but if to praise or blame you cannot say endlinehere startlinehere for who decries the loved decries the lover yet what man lauds the thing hes thrown away endlinehere startlinehere dear fool pity the fool who thought you clever endlinehere startlinehere dear wisdom do not mock the fool that missed you endlinehere startlinehere most fair the blind has lost your face for ever endlinehere startlinehere most foul how could i see you while i kissed you endlinehere startlinehere the poor love of fools and blind ive proved you for foul or lovely twas a fool that loved you endlinehere startlinehere somewhile before the dawn i rose and stept softly along the dim way to your room and found you sleeping in the quiet gloom and holiness about you as you slept endlinehere startlinehere i knelt there till your waking fingers crept about my head and held it endlinehere startlinehere i had rest unhoped this side of heaven beneath your breast endlinehere startlinehere i knelt a long time still nor even wept endlinehere startlinehere it was great wrong you did me and for gain of that poor moments kindliness and ease and sleepy mother comfort endlinehere startlinehere child you know how easily love leaps out to dreams like these who has seen them true endlinehere startlinehere and love thats wakened so takes all too long to lay asleep again endlinehere startlinehere waikiki october today i have been happy endlinehere startlinehere the pacific october warm perfumes like a breath from vine and tree drift down the darkness endlinehere startlinehere plangent hidden from eyes somewhere an eukaleli thrills and cries and stabs with pain the nights brown savagery endlinehere startlinehere and dark scents whisper and dim waves creep to me gleam like a womans hair stretch out and rise and new stars burn into the ancient skies over the murmurous soft hawaian sea endlinehere startlinehere down the blue night the unending columns press in noiseless tumult break and wave and flow now tread the far south or lift rounds of snow up to the white moons hidden loveliness endlinehere startlinehere some pause in their grave wandering comradeless and turn with profound gesture vague and slow as who would pray good for the world but know their benediction empty as they bless endlinehere startlinehere they say that the dead die not but remain near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth endlinehere startlinehere i think they ride the calm mid heaven as these in wise majestic melancholy train and watch the moon and the still raging seas and men coming and going on the earth endlinehere startlinehere there the sure suns of these pale shadows move there stand the immortal ensigns of our war our melting flesh fixed beauty there a star and perishing hearts imperishable love endlinehere startlinehere dear we know only that we sigh kiss smile each kiss lasts but the kissing and grief goes over love has no habitation but the heart endlinehere startlinehere on the dark flood we catch awhile cling and are borne into the night apart endlinehere startlinehere the laugh dies with the lips love with the lover endlinehere startlinehere south kensington makaweli now that weve done our best and worst and parted i would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend endlinehere startlinehere i would think of a thousand things lovely and durable and taste them slowly one after one like tasting a sweet food endlinehere startlinehere i have need to busy my heart with quietude endlinehere startlinehere love is a breach in the walls a broken gate where that comes in that shall not go again love sells the proud hearts citadel to fate endlinehere startlinehere they have known shame who love unloved endlinehere startlinehere some share that night endlinehere startlinehere but they know love grows colder grows false and dull that was sweet lies at most endlinehere startlinehere astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder but darkens and dies out from kiss to kiss endlinehere startlinehere all this is love and all love is but this endlinehere startlinehere heart you are restless as a paper scrap thats tossed down dusty pavements by the wind saying she is most wise patient and kind endlinehere startlinehere come to her come to her endlinehere startlinehere she will not care endlinehere startlinehere shell smile to see me come so that i think all heaven in flower to fold me endlinehere startlinehere shell give me all i ask kiss me and hold me and open wide upon that holy air the gates of peace and take my tiredness home kinder than god endlinehere startlinehere but heart she will not care endlinehere startlinehere your hands my dear adorable your lips of tenderness oh ive loved you faithfully and well three years or a bit less endlinehere startlinehere thank god thats done endlinehere startlinehere and ill take the road quit of my youth and you the roman road to wendover by tring and lilley hoo as a free man may do endlinehere startlinehere for youth goes over the joys that fly the tears that follow fast and the dirtiest things we do must lie forgotten at the last even love goes past endlinehere startlinehere whats left behind i shall not find the splendour and the pain the splash of sun the shouting wind and the brave sting of rain i may not meet again endlinehere startlinehere but the years that take the best away give something in the end and a better friend than love have they for none to mar or mend that have themselves to friend endlinehere startlinehere i shall desire and i shall find the best of my desires the autumn road the mellow wind that soothes the darkening shires endlinehere startlinehere and laughter and inn fires endlinehere startlinehere white mist about the black hedgerows the slumbering midland plain the silence where the clover grows and the dead leaves in the lane certainly these remain endlinehere startlinehere and i shall find some girl perhaps and a better one than you with eyes as wise but kindlier and lips as soft but true endlinehere startlinehere and i daresay she will do endlinehere startlinehere i came back late and tired last night into my little room to the long chair and the firelight and comfortable gloom endlinehere startlinehere i stood a moment fierce and still watching her neck and hair endlinehere startlinehere i made a step to her and saw that there was no one there endlinehere startlinehere it was some trick of the firelight that made me see her there endlinehere startlinehere it was a chance of shade and light and the cushion in the chair endlinehere startlinehere oh all you happy over the earth that night how could i sleep endlinehere startlinehere i lay and watched the lonely gloom and watched the moonlight creep from wall to basin round the room all night i could not sleep endlinehere startlinehere hands and lit faces eddy to a line the dazed last minutes click the clamour dies endlinehere startlinehere beyond the great swung arc o the roof divine night smoky scarvd with thousand coloured eyes glares the imperious mystery of the way endlinehere startlinehere thirsty for dark you feel the long limbed train throb stretch thrill motion slide pull out and sway strain for the far pause draw to strength again endlinehere startlinehere there is an end appointed o my soul endlinehere startlinehere crimson and green the signals burn the gloom is hung with steams far blowing livid streamers endlinehere startlinehere lost into god as lights in light we fly grown one with will end drunken huddled dreamers endlinehere startlinehere the white lights roar endlinehere startlinehere the sounds of the world die endlinehere startlinehere and lips and laughter are forgotten things endlinehere startlinehere speed sharpens grows endlinehere startlinehere into the night and on the strength and splendour of our purpose swings endlinehere startlinehere the lamps fade and the stars endlinehere startlinehere we are alone endlinehere startlinehere all suddenly the wind comes soft and spring is here again and the hawthorn quickens with buds of green and my heart with buds of pain endlinehere startlinehere my heart all winter lay so numb the earth so dead and frore that i never thought the spring would come or my heart wake any more endlinehere startlinehere but winters broken and earth has woken and the small birds cry again and the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds and my heart puts forth its pain endlinehere startlinehere they queerly find some healing so and strange attainment in the touch there is a secret lovers know i have read as much endlinehere startlinehere and theirs no longer joy nor smart changing or ending night or day but mouth to mouth and heart on heart so lovers say endlinehere startlinehere young mary loitering once her garden way felt a warm splendour grow in the april day as wine that blushes water through endlinehere startlinehere and soon out of the gold air of the afternoon one knelt before her hair he had or fire bound back above his ears with golden wire baring the eager marble of his face endlinehere startlinehere not mans nor womans was the immortal grace rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white and lighting the proud eyes with changeless light incurious endlinehere startlinehere calm as his wings and fair that presence filled the garden endlinehere startlinehere she stood there saying what would you sir endlinehere startlinehere he told his word blessed art thou of women endlinehere startlinehere her breath came quick as little flakes of snow endlinehere startlinehere her hands crept up her breast endlinehere startlinehere she did but know it was not hers endlinehere startlinehere she felt a trembling stir within her body a will too strong for her that held and filled and mastered all endlinehere startlinehere with eyes closed and a thousand soft short broken sighs she gave submission fearful meek and glad endlinehere startlinehere she wished to speak endlinehere startlinehere her heart was faint for telling to relate her limbs sweet treachery her strange high estate over and over whispering half revealing weeping and so find kindness to her healing endlinehere startlinehere twixt tears and laughter panic hurrying her she raised her eyes to that fair messenger endlinehere startlinehere he knelt unmoved immortal with his eyes gazing beyond her calm to the calm skies radiant untroubled in his wisdom kind endlinehere startlinehere his sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind endlinehere startlinehere being tired she bowed her head and said so be it endlinehere startlinehere the great wings were spread showering glory on the fields and fire endlinehere startlinehere the whole air singing bore him up and higher unswerving unreluctant endlinehere startlinehere soon he shone a gold speck in the gold skies then was gone endlinehere startlinehere the air was colder and grey endlinehere startlinehere behind them broken hearted came grief so noisy a widow that all said had he but wed her elder sister sorrow in her stead endlinehere startlinehere and by her trying to soothe her all the time the fatherless children colour tune and rhyme the sweet lad rhyme ran all uncomprehending endlinehere startlinehere then at the ways sad ending round the raw grave they stayd endlinehere startlinehere old wisdom read in mumbling tone the service for the dead endlinehere startlinehere beauty was there pale in her black dry eyed she stood alone endlinehere startlinehere poor mazd imagination fancy wild ardour the sunlight on his greying hair contentment who had known youth as a child and never seen him since endlinehere startlinehere and spring came too dancing over the tombs and brought him flowers she did not stay for long endlinehere startlinehere love had died long ago endlinehere startlinehere and i know how the may fields all golden show and when the day is young and sweet gild gloriously the bare feet that run to bathe endlinehere startlinehere du lieber gott endlinehere startlinehere here am i sweating sick and hot and there the shadowed waters fresh lean up to embrace the naked flesh endlinehere startlinehere temperamentvoll german jews drink beer around and there the dews are soft beneath a morn of gold endlinehere startlinehere in grantchester in grantchester endlinehere startlinehere some it may be can get in touch with nature there or earth or such endlinehere startlinehere and clever modern men have seen a faun a peeping through the green and felt the classics were not dead to glimpse a naiads reedy head or hear the goat foot piping low endlinehere startlinehere but these are things i do not know endlinehere startlinehere still in the dawnlit waters cool his ghostly lordship swims his pool and tries the strokes essays the tricks long learnt on hellespont or styx endlinehere startlinehere dan chaucer hears his river still chatter beneath a phantom mill endlinehere startlinehere tennyson notes with studious eye how cambridge waters hurry by endlinehere startlinehere till at a shiver in the skies vanishing with satanic cries the prim ecclesiastic rout leaves but a startled sleeper out grey

may thy passing joyous be to thy father the great sea for the sun is getting stronger earth hath need of thee no longer go kind snow god speed to thee endlinehere startlinehere i break the spirits cloudy bands a wanderer in enchanted lands i feel the sun upon my hands and far from care and strife the broad earth bids me forth endlinehere startlinehere i rise with lifted brow and upward eyes endlinehere startlinehere i bathe my spirit in blue skies and taste the springs of life endlinehere startlinehere there is singing of birds in the deep wet woods in the heart of the listening solitudes pewees and thrushes and sparrows not few and all the notes of their throats are true endlinehere startlinehere the thrush from the innermost ash takes on a tender dream of the treasured and gone but the sparrow singeth with pride and cheer of the might and light of the present and here endlinehere startlinehere there is shining of flowers in the deep wet woods in the heart of the sensitive solitudes the roseate bell and the lily are there and every leaf of their sheaf is fair endlinehere startlinehere careless and bold without dream of woe the trilliums scatter their flags snow but the pale wood daffodil covers her face agloom with the doom of a sorrowful race endlinehere startlinehere the vesper sparrows song the stress of yearning notes that gush and stream the lyric joy the tenderness and once again the dream endlinehere startlinehere a touch of far off joy and power a something it is life to learn comes back to earth and one short hour the glamours of the gods return endlinehere startlinehere this lifes old mood and cult of care falls smitten by an older truth and the gray world wins back to her the rapture of her vanished youth endlinehere startlinehere dead thoughts revive and he that heeds shall hear as by a spirit led a song among the golden reeds the gods are vanished but not dead endlinehere startlinehere for one short hour unseen yet near they haunt us a forgotten mood a glory upon mead and mere a magic in the leafless wood endlinehere startlinehere at morning we shall catch the glow of dians quiver on the hill and somewhere in the glades i know that pan is at his piping still endlinehere startlinehere now though no more by marsh or stream or dewy forest sounds the secret reed for pan is gone ah yet the infinite dream still lives for them that heed endlinehere startlinehere an old world joyousness supreme the warmth and glow of an immortal balm the mood touch of the gods the endless dream the high lethean calm endlinehere startlinehere they see wide on the eternal way the services of earth the life of man and listening to the magic cry they say it is the note of pan endlinehere startlinehere here the slim pinioned swallows sweep and pass down to the far off river the black crow with wise and wary visage to and fro settles and stalks about the withered grass endlinehere startlinehere here too the robins lusty as of old hunt the waste grass for forage or prolong from every quarter of these fields the bold blithe phrases of their never finished song endlinehere startlinehere the white throats distant descant with slow stress note after note upon the noonday falls filling the leisured air at intervals with his own mood of piercing pensiveness endlinehere startlinehere grief was my master yesternight to morrow i may grieve again but now along the windy plain the clouds have taken flight endlinehere startlinehere the roads far off are towered with dust the cherry blooms are swept and thinned in yonder swaying elms the wind is charging gust on gust endlinehere startlinehere but here there is no stir at all the ministers of sun and shadow horde all the perfumes of the meadow behind a grassy wall endlinehere startlinehere an infant rivulet wind free adown the guarded hollow sets over whose brink the violets are nodding peacefully endlinehere startlinehere from pool to pool it prattles by the flashing swallows dip and pass above the tufted marish grass and here at rest am i endlinehere startlinehere i care not for the old distress nor if to morrow bid me moan to day is mine and i have known an hour of blessedness endlinehere startlinehere i passed through the gates of the city the streets were strange and still through the doors of the open churches the organs were moaning shrill endlinehere startlinehere i strayed through the midst of the city like one distracted or mad endlinehere startlinehere i kept saying and the very word seemed sad endlinehere startlinehere i passed through the gates of the city and i heard the small birds sing i laid me down in the meadows afar from the bell ringing endlinehere startlinehere in the depth and the bloom of the meadows i lay on the earths quiet breast the poplar fanned me with shadows and the veery sang me to rest endlinehere startlinehere blue blue was the heaven above me and the earth green at my feet oh life endlinehere startlinehere i kept saying and the very word seemed sweet endlinehere startlinehere high in the hills the solitary thrush tunes magically his music of fine dreams in briary dells by boulder broken streams and wide and far on nebulous fields aflush the mellow morning gleams endlinehere startlinehere the orange cone flowers purple bossed are there the meadows bold eyed gypsies deep of hue and slender hawkweed tall and softly fair and rosy tops of fleabane veiled with dew endlinehere startlinehere dim surging motions and uneasy dreads scare the light slumber from mens busy eyes and parted lovers on their restless beds toss and yearn out and cannot sleep for sighs endlinehere startlinehere ah the distance endlinehere startlinehere blue and broad and dim endlinehere startlinehere peace is not in burgh or meadow but beyond the rim endlinehere startlinehere aye beyond it far beyond it follow still my soul till this earth is lost in heaven and thou feelst the whole endlinehere startlinehere and yet a moment more out of the silent wood as if from the closing door of another world and another lovelier mood hearst thou the hermit pour so sweet endlinehere startlinehere his golden music ghostly beautiful endlinehere startlinehere but when the fourth day came at noon the darkness and the rain were by the sunward roofs were steaming dry and all the world was flecked and strewn with shadows from a fleecy sky endlinehere startlinehere the haymakers were forth and gone and every rillet laughed and shone endlinehere startlinehere with a turn of his magical rod that extended and suddenly shone from the round of his glory some god looks forth and is gone endlinehere startlinehere to the summit of heaven the clouds are rolling aloft like steam theres a break in their infinite shrouds and below it a gleam endlinehere startlinehere oer the drift of the river a whiff comes out from the blossoming shore and the meadows are greening as if they never were green before endlinehere startlinehere the islands are kindled with gold and russet and emerald dye and the interval waters outrolled are more blue than the sky endlinehere startlinehere from my feet to the heart of the hills the spirits of may intervene and a vapor of azure distills like a breath on the opaline green endlinehere startlinehere and then the chill and the shadow decline on the eyes of rejuvenate men that were wide and divine endlinehere startlinehere the full clear moon uprose and spread her cold pale splendor oer the sea a light strewn path that seemed to lead outward into eternity endlinehere startlinehere between the darkness and the gleam an old world spell encompassed me methought that in a godlike dream i trod upon the sea endlinehere startlinehere what wouldst thou have for easement after grief when the rude world hath used thee with despite and care sits at thine elbow day and night filching thy pleasures like a subtle thief endlinehere startlinehere on such a day the shrunken stream spends its last water and runs dry clouds like far turrets in a dream stand baseless in the burning sky endlinehere startlinehere on such a day at every rod the toilers in the hay field halt with dripping brows and the parched sod yields to the crushing foot like salt endlinehere startlinehere i watch the swinging currents go far down to where enclosed and piled the logs crowd and the gatineau comes rushing from the northern wild endlinehere startlinehere i see the long low point where close the shore lines and the waters end i watch the barges pass in rows that vanish at the tapering bend endlinehere startlinehere i see no more the barges pass nor mark the ripple round the pier and all the uproar mass on mass falls dead upon a vacant ear endlinehere startlinehere beyond the tumult of the mills and all the citys sound and strife beyond the waste beyond the hills i look far out and dream of life endlinehere startlinehere around the long low shanties whose rough lines break the sealed dreams of many an unnamed lake already in the frost clear morns awake the crash and thunder of the falling pines endlinehere startlinehere with what doubting eyes oh sparrow thou regardest me underneath yon spray of yarrow dipping cautiously endlinehere startlinehere fear me not oh little sparrow bathe and never fear for to me both pool and yarrow and thyself are dear endlinehere startlinehere and on beside the rivers sober edge a long fresh field lies black endlinehere startlinehere beyond low thickets gray and reddish stand stroked white with birch and near at hand over a little steel smooth pond hang multitudes of thin and withering sedge endlinehere startlinehere across a waste and solitary rise a ploughman urges his dull team a stooped gray figure with prone brow that plunges bending to the plough with strong uneven steps endlinehere startlinehere the stream rings and re echoes with his furious cries endlinehere startlinehere sometimes the lowing of a cow long drawn comes from far off and crows in strings pass on the upper silences endlinehere startlinehere a flock of small gray goldfinches flown down with silvery twitterings rustle among the birch cones and are gone endlinehere startlinehere it was a bleak and sandy spot and all about the vacant plot was peopled and inhabited by scores of mulleins long since dead endlinehere startlinehere there was no sound about the wood save the winds secret stir endlinehere startlinehere i stood among the mullein stalks as still as if myself had grown to be one of their sombre company a body without wish or will endlinehere startlinehere now overhead where the rivulet loiters and stops the bittersweet hangs from the tops of the alders and cherries its bunches of beautiful berries orange and red endlinehere startlinehere and the snowbirds flee tossing up on the far brown field now flashing and now concealed like fringes of spray that vanish and gleam on the gray field of the sea endlinehere startlinehere flickering light come the last of the leaves down borne and patches of pale white corn in the wind complain like the slow rustle of rain noticed by night endlinehere startlinehere withered and thinned the sentinel mullein looms with the pale gray shadowy plumes of the goldenrod and the milkweed opens its pod tempting the wind endlinehere startlinehere aloft on the hill a cloudrift opens and shines through a break in its gorget of pines and it dreams at my feet in a sad silvery sheet utterly still endlinehere startlinehere all things that be seem plunged into silence distraught by some stern some necessitous thought it wraps and enthralls marsh meadow and forest and falls also on me endlinehere startlinehere along the narrow sandy height i watch them swiftly come and go or round the leafless wood like flurries of wind driven snow revolving in perpetual flight a changing multitude endlinehere startlinehere white are the far off plains and white the fading forests grow the wind dies out along the height and denser still the snow a gathering weight on roof and tree falls down scarce audibly endlinehere startlinehere the road before me smooths and fills apace and all about the fences dwindle and the hills are blotted slowly out the naked trees loom spectrally into the dim white sky endlinehere startlinehere the meadows and far sheeted streams lie still without a sound like some soft minister of dreams the snow fall hoods me round in wood and water earth and air a silence everywhere endlinehere startlinehere the evening deepens and the gray folds closer earth and sky the world seems shrouded far away its noises sleep and i as secret as yon buried stream plod dumbly on and dream endlinehere startlinehere from this windy bridge at rest in some former curious hour we have watched the citys hue all along the orange west cupola and pointed tower darken into solid blue endlinehere startlinehere subtly conscious all awake let us clear our eyes and break through the cloudy chrysalis see the wonder as it is endlinehere startlinehere creeping by the sullen wall we forego the power to see the threads that bind us to the all god or the immensity whereof on the eternal road man is but a passing mode endlinehere startlinehere up the fielded slopes at morn where light wefts of shadow pass films upon the bending corn i shall sweep the purple grass endlinehere startlinehere sun crowned heights and mossy woods and the outer solitudes mountain valleys dim with pine shall be home and haunt of mine endlinehere startlinehere i shall search in crannied hollows where the sunlight scarcely follows and the secret forest brook murmurs and from nook to nook forever downward curls and cools frothing in the bouldered pools endlinehere startlinehere i shall stray by many a stream where the half shut lilies gleam endlinehere startlinehere napping out the sultry days in the quiet secluded bays where the tasseled rushes tower oer the purple pickerel flower endlinehere startlinehere i shall hear the grasshoppers from the parched grass rehearse and with drowsy note prolong evermore the same thin song endlinehere startlinehere i shall hear the crickets tell stories by the humming well and mark the locust with quaint eyes caper in his cloak of gray like a jester in disguise rattling by the dusty way endlinehere startlinehere i shall dream by upland fences where the seasons wealth condenses over many a weedy wreck wild uncared for desert places that sovereign beauty loves to deck with her softest dearest graces endlinehere startlinehere there the long year dreams in quiet and the summers strength runs riot endlinehere startlinehere shall i not remember these deep in winter reveries endlinehere startlinehere it holds me fast endlinehere startlinehere a drifting april twilight sky a wind which blew the puddles dry and slapped the river into waves that ran and hid among the staves of an old wharf endlinehere startlinehere a watery light touched bleak the granite bridge and white without the slightest tinge of gold the city shivered in the cold endlinehere startlinehere all day my thoughts had lain as dead unborn and bursting in my head endlinehere startlinehere from time to time i wrote a word which lines and circles overscored endlinehere startlinehere my table seemed a graveyard full of coffins waiting burial endlinehere startlinehere i seized these vile abortions tore them into jagged bits and swore to be the dupe of hope no more endlinehere startlinehere into the evening straight i went starved of a days accomplishment endlinehere startlinehere unnoticing i wandered where the city gave a space for air and on the bridges parapet i leant while pallidly there set a dim discouraged worn out sun endlinehere startlinehere behind me where the tramways run blossomed bright lights i turned to leave when someone plucked me by the sleeve endlinehere startlinehere your pardon sir but i should be most grateful could you lend to me a carfare i have lost my purse endlinehere startlinehere the voice was clear concise and terse endlinehere startlinehere i turned and met the quiet gaze of strange eyes flashing through the haze endlinehere startlinehere like some spanish don conferring favours even when asking an alms he bowed again and waited endlinehere startlinehere but my pockets proved empty in vain i poked and shoved no hidden penny lurking there greeted my search endlinehere startlinehere sir i declare i have no money pray forgive but let me take you where you live endlinehere startlinehere and so we plodded through the mire where street lamps cast a wavering fire endlinehere startlinehere i took no note of where we went his talk became the element wherein my being swam content endlinehere startlinehere it flashed like rapiers in the night lit by uncertain candle light when on some moon forsaken sward a quarrel dies upon a sword endlinehere startlinehere it hacked and carved like a cutlass blade and the noise in the air the broad words made was the cry of the wind at a window pane on an autumn night of sobbing rain endlinehere startlinehere i walked as though some opiate had stung and dulled my brain a state acute and slumbrous endlinehere startlinehere we stopped a house stood silent dark endlinehere startlinehere from the chimney red eyes sparked the gloom and a crickets chirp filled all the room endlinehere startlinehere my host threw pine cones on the fire and crimson and scarlet glowed the pyre wrapped in the golden flames desire endlinehere startlinehere the chamber opened like an eye as a half melted cloud in a summer sky the soul of the house stood guessed and shy it peered at the stranger warily endlinehere startlinehere a little shop with its various ware spread on shelves with nicest care endlinehere startlinehere pitchers and jars and jugs and pots pipkins and mugs and many lots of lacquered canisters black and gold like those in which chinese tea is sold endlinehere startlinehere chests and puncheons kegs and flasks goblets chalices firkins and casks endlinehere startlinehere in a corner three ancient amphorae leaned against the wall like ships careened endlinehere startlinehere there was dusky blue of wedgewood ware the carved white figures fluttering there like leaves adrift upon the air endlinehere startlinehere classic in touch but emasculate the greek soul grown effeminate endlinehere startlinehere eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt hand on heart and daintily spelt their love in flowers brittle and bright artificial and fragile which told aright the vows of an eighteenth century knight endlinehere startlinehere the cruder tones of old dutch jugs glared from one shelf where toby mugs endlessly drank the foaming ale its froth grown dusty awaiting sale endlinehere startlinehere ah i see said i you deal in pottery endlinehere startlinehere the old man turned and looked at me endlinehere startlinehere shook his head gently endlinehere startlinehere then from under his cloak he took the thing which i had wondered to see him bring guarded so carefully from sight endlinehere startlinehere the old man smiled it has no sheath twas a little careless to have it beneath my cloak for a jostle to my arm would have resulted in serious harm endlinehere startlinehere but it was so fine i could not wait so i brought it with me despite its state endlinehere startlinehere an amateur of arms i thought bringing home a prize which he has bought endlinehere startlinehere you care for this sort of thing dear sir endlinehere startlinehere not in the way which you infer endlinehere startlinehere i need them in business that is all endlinehere startlinehere and he pointed his finger at the wall endlinehere startlinehere then i saw what i had not noticed before endlinehere startlinehere the walls were hung with at least five score of swords and daggers of every size which nations of militant men could devise endlinehere startlinehere poisoned spears from tropic seas that natives under banana trees smear with the juice of some deadly snake endlinehere startlinehere blood dipped arrows which savages make and tip with feathers orange and green a quivering death in harlequin sheen endlinehere startlinehere high up a fan of glancing steel was formed of claymores in a wheel endlinehere startlinehere jewelled swords worn at kings levees were suspended next midshipmens dirks and these elbowed stilettos come from spain chased with some splendid hidalgos name endlinehere startlinehere foils with buttons broken or lost lay heaped on a chair among them tossed the boarding pike of a privateer endlinehere startlinehere against the chimney leaned a queer two handed weapon with edges dull as though from hacking on a skull endlinehere startlinehere the rusted blood corroded it still endlinehere startlinehere my host took up a paper spill from a heap which lay in an earthen bowl and lighted it at a burning coal endlinehere startlinehere at either end of the table tall wax candles were placed each in a small and slim and burnished candlestick of pewter endlinehere startlinehere the old man lit each wick and the room leapt more obviously upon my mind and i could see what the flickering fire had hid from me endlinehere startlinehere my head grew dizzy i seemed to hear a battle cry from somewhere near the clash of arms and the squeal of balls and the echoless thud when a dead man falls endlinehere startlinehere a smoky cloud had veiled the room shot through with lurid glares the gloom pounded with shouts and dying groans with the drip of blood on cold hard stones endlinehere startlinehere sabres and lances in streaks of light gleamed through the smoke and at my right a creese like a licking serpents tongue glittered an instant while it stung endlinehere startlinehere streams and points and lines of fire endlinehere startlinehere the livid steel which mans desire had forged and welded burned white and cold endlinehere startlinehere nerveless and shaking round and round i stared at the walls and at the ground till the room spun like a whipping top and a stern voice in my ear said stop endlinehere startlinehere i sell no tools for murderers here endlinehere startlinehere of what are you thinking endlinehere startlinehere please clear your mind of such imaginings endlinehere startlinehere i will tell you of these things endlinehere startlinehere he pushed me into a great chair of russet leather poked a flare of tumbling flame with the old long sword up the chimney but said no word endlinehere startlinehere slowly he walked to a distant shelf and brought back a crock of finest delf endlinehere startlinehere he rested a moment a blue veined hand upon the cover then cut a band of paper pasted neatly round opened and poured endlinehere startlinehere a sliding sound came from beneath his old white hands and i saw a little heap of sands black and smooth endlinehere startlinehere what could they be pepper i thought endlinehere startlinehere he looked at me endlinehere startlinehere what you see is poppy seed endlinehere startlinehere lethean dreams for those in need endlinehere startlinehere he took up the grains with a gentle hand and sifted them slowly like hour glass sand endlinehere startlinehere on his old white finger the almandine shot out its rays incarnadine endlinehere startlinehere visions for those too tired to sleep endlinehere startlinehere these seeds cast a film over eyes which weep endlinehere startlinehere no single soul in the world could dwell without these poppy seeds i sell endlinehere startlinehere for a moment he played with the shining stuff passing it through his fingers endlinehere startlinehere enough at last he poured it back into the china jar of holland blue which he carefully carried to its place endlinehere startlinehere then with a smile on his aged face he drew up a chair to the open space twixt table and chimney endlinehere startlinehere without preface young man i will say that what you see is not the puzzle you take it to be endlinehere startlinehere but surely sir there is something strange in a shop with goods at so wide a range each from the other as swords and seeds endlinehere startlinehere your neighbours must have greatly differing needs endlinehere startlinehere my neighbours he said and he stroked his chin live everywhere from here to pekin endlinehere startlinehere but you are wrong my sort of goods is but one thing in all its moods endlinehere startlinehere he took a shagreen letter case from his pocket and with charming grace offered me a printed card endlinehere startlinehere i read the legend ephraim bard endlinehere startlinehere dealer in words endlinehere startlinehere and that was all endlinehere startlinehere i stared at the letters whimsical indeed or was it merely a jest endlinehere startlinehere he answered my unasked request all books are either dreams or swords you can cut or you can drug with words endlinehere startlinehere my firm is a very ancient house the entries on my books would rouse your wonder perhaps incredulity endlinehere startlinehere i inherited from an ancestry stretching remotely back and far this business and my clients are as were those of my grandfathers days writers of books and poems and plays endlinehere startlinehere my swords are tempered for every speech for fencing wit or to carve a breach through old abuses the world condones endlinehere startlinehere these are purchased by men who feel the need of stabbing societys heel which egotism has brought them to think is set on their necks endlinehere startlinehere i have foils to pink an adversary to quaint reply and i have customers who buy scalpels with which to dissect the brains and hearts of men endlinehere startlinehere ultramundanes even demand some finer kinds to open their own souls and minds endlinehere startlinehere but the other half of my business deals with visions and fancies endlinehere startlinehere under seals sorted and placed in vessels here i keep the seeds of an atmosphere endlinehere startlinehere each jar contains a different kind of poppy seed endlinehere startlinehere from farthest ind come the purple flowers opium filled from which the weirdest myths are distilled my orient porcelains contain them all endlinehere startlinehere every castle of the air sleeps in the fine black grains and there are seeds for every romance or light whiff of a dream for a summer night endlinehere startlinehere i supply to every want and taste endlinehere startlinehere twas slowly said in no great haste he seemed to push his wares but i dumfounded listened endlinehere startlinehere by and by a log on the fire broke in two endlinehere startlinehere he looked up quickly sir and you endlinehere startlinehere i groped for something i should say amazement held me numb endlinehere startlinehere to day you sweated at a fruitless task endlinehere startlinehere he spoke for me what do you ask endlinehere startlinehere how can i serve you endlinehere startlinehere my kind host my penniless state was not a boast i have no money with me endlinehere startlinehere not for that money i beguiled you here you paid me in advance endlinehere startlinehere again i felt as though a trance had dimmed my faculties endlinehere startlinehere again he spoke and this time to explain endlinehere startlinehere the money i demand is life your nervous force your joy your strife endlinehere startlinehere what infamous proposal now was made me with so calm a brow endlinehere startlinehere bursting through my lethargy indignantly i hurled the cry is this a nightmare or am i drunk with some infernal wine endlinehere startlinehere i am no faust and what is mine is what i call my soul endlinehere startlinehere devil or ghost endlinehere startlinehere your hellish plan revolts me endlinehere startlinehere my child and the old tones were very mild i have no wish to barter souls my traffic does not ask such tolls endlinehere startlinehere i am no devil is there one endlinehere startlinehere surely the age of fear is gone endlinehere startlinehere we live within a daylight world lit by the sun where winds unfurled sweep clouds to scatter pattering rain and then blow back the sun again endlinehere startlinehere i sell my fancies or my swords to those who care far more for words ideas of which they are the sign than any other life design endlinehere startlinehere i claim for all the goods i sell that they will serve their purpose well and though you perish they will live endlinehere startlinehere full measure for your pay i give endlinehere startlinehere to day you worked you thought in vain endlinehere startlinehere what since has happened is the train your toiling brought endlinehere startlinehere i spoke to you for my share of the bargain due endlinehere startlinehere and is that all you crave in pay endlinehere startlinehere what even childhood gave endlinehere startlinehere i have been dedicate from youth endlinehere startlinehere before my god i speak the truth endlinehere startlinehere fatigue excitement of the past few hours broke me down at last endlinehere startlinehere all day i had forgot to eat my nerves betrayed me lacking meat endlinehere startlinehere i bowed my head and felt the storm plough shattering through my prostrate form endlinehere startlinehere the tearless sobs tore at my heart endlinehere startlinehere my host withdrew himself apart busied among his crockery he paid no farther heed to me endlinehere startlinehere exhausted spent i huddled there within the arms of the old carved chair endlinehere startlinehere a long half hour dragged away and then i heard a kind voice say the day will soon be dawning when you must begin to work again endlinehere startlinehere here are the things which you require endlinehere startlinehere by the fading light of the dying fire and by the guttering candles flare i saw the old man standing there endlinehere startlinehere he handed me a packet tied with crimson tape and sealed endlinehere startlinehere inside are seeds of many differing flowers to occupy your utmost powers of storied vision and these swords are the finest which my shop affords endlinehere startlinehere go home and use them do not spare yourself let that be all your care endlinehere startlinehere whatever you have means to buy be very sure i can supply endlinehere startlinehere he slowly walked to the window flung it open and in the grey air rung the sound of distant matin bells endlinehere startlinehere i took my parcels endlinehere startlinehere then as tells an ancient mumbling monk his beads i tried to thank for his courteous deeds my strange old friend endlinehere startlinehere nay do not talk he urged me you have a long walk before you endlinehere startlinehere and gently sped upon my way i stumbled out in the morning hush as down the empty street a flush ran level from the rising sun endlinehere startlinehere another day was just begun endlinehere startlinehere over the housetops above the rotating chimney pots i have seen a shiver of amethyst and blue and cinnamon have flickered a moment at the far end of a dusty street endlinehere startlinehere through sheeted rain has come a lustre of crimson and i have watched moonbeams hushed by a film of palest green endlinehere startlinehere it was her wings goddess endlinehere startlinehere who stepped over the clouds and laid her rainbow feathers aslant on the currents of the air endlinehere startlinehere i followed her for long with gazing eyes and stumbling feet endlinehere startlinehere i followed and watched for the flashing of her wings endlinehere startlinehere in the city i found her the narrow streeted city endlinehere startlinehere in the market place i came upon her bound and trembling endlinehere startlinehere her fluted wings were fastened to her sides with cords she was naked and cold for that day the wind blew without sunshine endlinehere startlinehere men chaffered for her they bargained in silver and gold in copper in wheat and called their bids across the market place endlinehere startlinehere the tall yellow hollyhocks stand still and straight with their round blossoms spread open in the quiet sunshine endlinehere startlinehere and still is the old roman wall rough with jagged bits of flint and jutting stones old and cragged quite still in its antiquity endlinehere startlinehere the pear trees press their branches against it and feeling it warm and kindly the little pears ripen to yellow and red endlinehere startlinehere they hang heavy bursting with juice against the wall endlinehere startlinehere so old so still endlinehere startlinehere the sky is still endlinehere startlinehere the clouds make no sound as they slide away beyond the cathedral tower to the river and the sea endlinehere startlinehere it is very quiet very sunny endlinehere startlinehere the myrtle flowers stretch themselves in the sunshine but make no sound endlinehere startlinehere the roses push their little tendrils up and climb higher and higher endlinehere startlinehere in spots they have climbed over the wall endlinehere startlinehere but they are very still they do not seem to move endlinehere startlinehere and the old wall carries them without effort and quietly ripens and shields the vines and blossoms endlinehere startlinehere a bird in a plane tree sings a few notes cadenced and perfect they weave into the silence endlinehere startlinehere the cathedral bell knocks one two three and again and then again endlinehere startlinehere it is a quiet sound calling to prayer hardly scattering the stillness only making it close in more densely endlinehere startlinehere the gardener picks ripe gooseberries for the deans supper to night endlinehere startlinehere it is very quiet very regulated and mellow endlinehere startlinehere but the wall is old it has known many days endlinehere startlinehere it is a roman wall left over and forgotten endlinehere startlinehere beyond the cathedral close yelp and mutter the discontents of people not mellow not well regulated endlinehere startlinehere people who care more for bread than for beauty who would break the tombs of saints and give the painted windows of churches to their children for toys endlinehere startlinehere people who say they are dead we live endlinehere startlinehere the world is for the living endlinehere startlinehere it is always the dead who breed endlinehere startlinehere crush the ripe fruit and cast it aside yet its seeds shall fructify and trees rise where your huts were standing endlinehere startlinehere but the little people are ignorant they chaffer and swarm endlinehere startlinehere they gnaw like rats and the foundations of the cathedral are honeycombed endlinehere startlinehere the dean is in the chapter house he is reading the architects bill for the completed restoration of the cathedral endlinehere startlinehere he will have ripe gooseberries for supper and then he will walk up and down the path by the wall and admire the snapdragons and dahlias thinking how quiet and peaceful the garden is endlinehere startlinehere the old wall will watch him very quietly and patiently it will watch endlinehere startlinehere for the wall is old it is a roman wall endlinehere startlinehere spread on the roadway with open blown jackets like black soaring pinions they swoop down the hillside the cyclists endlinehere startlinehere seeming dark plumaged birds after carrion careening and circling over the dying of england endlinehere startlinehere she lies with her bosom beneath them no longer the dominant mother the virile but rotting before time endlinehere startlinehere the smell of her tainted has bitten their nostrils endlinehere startlinehere what charm is yours you faded old world tapestries of outworn childish mysteries vague pageants woven on a web of dream endlinehere startlinehere and we pushing and fighting in the turbid stream of modern life find solace in your tarnished broideries endlinehere startlinehere old lichened halls sun shaded by huge cedar trees the layered branches horizontal stretched like japanese dark banded prints endlinehere startlinehere carven cathedrals on a sky of faintest colour where the gothic spires fly and sway like masts against a shifting breeze endlinehere startlinehere worm eaten pages clasped in old brown vellum shrunk from over handling by some anxious monk endlinehere startlinehere or virgins hours bright with gold and graven with flowers and rare birds and all the saints of heaven and noahs ark stuck on ararat when all the world had sunk endlinehere startlinehere they have watered the street it shines in the glare of lamps cold white lamps and lies like a slow moving river barred with silver and black endlinehere startlinehere cabs go down it one and then another endlinehere startlinehere between them i hear the shuffling of feet endlinehere startlinehere tramps doze on the window ledges night walkers pass along the sidewalks endlinehere startlinehere the city is squalid and sinister with the silver barred street in the midst slow moving a river leading nowhere endlinehere startlinehere opposite my window the moon cuts clear and round through the plum coloured night endlinehere startlinehere she cannot light the city it is too bright endlinehere startlinehere it has white lamps and glitters coldly endlinehere startlinehere i stand in the window and watch the moon endlinehere startlinehere she is thin and lustreless but i love her endlinehere startlinehere i know the moon and this is an alien city endlinehere startlinehere to ezra pound with much friendship and admiration and some differences of opinion the poet took his walking stick of fine and polished ebony endlinehere startlinehere set in the close grained wood were quaint devices patterns in ambers and in the clouded green of jades endlinehere startlinehere the top was of smooth yellow ivory and a tassel of tarnished gold hung by a faded cord from a hole pierced in the hard wood circled with silver endlinehere startlinehere for years the poet had wrought upon this cane endlinehere startlinehere his wealth had gone to enrich it his experiences to pattern it his labour to fashion and burnish it endlinehere startlinehere to him it was perfect a work of art and a weapon a delight and a defence endlinehere startlinehere the poet took his walking stick and walked abroad endlinehere startlinehere peace be with you brother endlinehere startlinehere the poet came to a meadow endlinehere startlinehere sifted through the grass were daisies open mouthed wondering they gazed at the sun endlinehere startlinehere the poet struck them with his cane endlinehere startlinehere the little heads flew off and they lay dying open mouthed and wondering on the hard ground endlinehere startlinehere they are not roses said the poet endlinehere startlinehere the poet came to a stream endlinehere startlinehere purple and blue flags waded in the water in among them hopped the speckled frogs the wind slid through them rustling endlinehere startlinehere the poet lifted his cane and the iris heads fell into the water endlinehere startlinehere they floated away torn and drowning endlinehere startlinehere wretched flowers said the poet they are not roses endlinehere startlinehere it is your affair endlinehere startlinehere the poet came to a garden endlinehere startlinehere dahlias ripened against a wall gillyflowers stood up bravely for all their short stature and a trumpet vine covered an arbour with the red and gold of its blossoms endlinehere startlinehere red and gold like the brass notes of trumpets endlinehere startlinehere the poet knocked off the stiff heads of the dahlias and his cane lopped the gillyflowers at the ground endlinehere startlinehere then he severed the trumpet blossoms from their stems endlinehere startlinehere red and gold they lay scattered red and gold as on a battle field red and gold prone and dying endlinehere startlinehere they were not roses said the poet endlinehere startlinehere but behind you is destruction and waste places endlinehere startlinehere the poet came home at evening and in the candle light he wiped and polished his cane endlinehere startlinehere the orange candle flame leaped in the yellow ambers and made the jades undulate like green pools endlinehere startlinehere it played along the bright ebony and glowed in the top of cream coloured ivory endlinehere startlinehere but these things were dead only the candle light made them seem to move endlinehere startlinehere it is a pity there were no roses said the poet endlinehere startlinehere he perches in the slime inert bedaubed with iridescent dirt endlinehere startlinehere the ground is here and there bestud with lumps of only part burned coal endlinehere startlinehere their sharp and glistening edges cut his stiffened fingers endlinehere startlinehere through the smut gleam red the wounds which will not shut endlinehere startlinehere wet through and shivering he kneels and digs the slippery coals like eels they slide about endlinehere startlinehere his force all spent he counts his small accomplishment endlinehere startlinehere a half a dozen clinker coals which still have fire in their souls endlinehere startlinehere and in his thought there burns the topaz fire of votive urns endlinehere startlinehere he sees it fling from hill to hill and still consumed is burning still endlinehere startlinehere higher and higher leaps the flame the smoke an ever shifting frame endlinehere startlinehere he sees a spanish castle old with silver steps and paths of gold endlinehere startlinehere from myrtle bowers comes the plash of fountains and the emerald flash of parrots in the orange trees whose blossoms pasture humming bees endlinehere startlinehere he knows he feeds the urns whose smoke bears visions that his master stroke is out of dirt and misery to light the fire of poesy endlinehere startlinehere he sees the glory yet he knows that others cannot see his shows endlinehere startlinehere to them his smoke is sightless black his votive vessels but a pack of old discarded shards his fire a peddlers still to him the pyre is incensed an enduring goal endlinehere startlinehere he sighs and grubs another coal endlinehere startlinehere how should i sing when buffeting salt waves and stung with bitter surges in whose might i toss a cockleshell endlinehere startlinehere no parting cloud reveals a watery star my cries are washed away upon the wind my cramped and blistering hands can find no spar my eyes with hope oerstrained are growing blind endlinehere startlinehere but painted on the sky great visions burn my voice oblation from a shattered urn endlinehere startlinehere so up and down and forward inch by inch he gains upon the shore where poppies glow and sandflies dance their little lives away endlinehere startlinehere when the stooping sky leans down upon the hills and tenderly as one who soothing stills an anguish gathers earth to lie embraced and girdled endlinehere startlinehere do the sun filled men feel patience then endlinehere startlinehere be patient with you endlinehere startlinehere when pains iron bars their rivets tighten stern to bend and break their victims as they turn hopeless there stand the purple jars of night to spill oblivion endlinehere startlinehere do these men feel patience then endlinehere startlinehere my sun and moon endlinehere startlinehere my basketful of flowers endlinehere startlinehere my money bag of shining dreams endlinehere startlinehere my hours windless and still of afternoon endlinehere startlinehere you are my world and i your citizen endlinehere startlinehere what meaning can have patience then endlinehere startlinehere be not angry with me that i bear your colours everywhere all through each crowded street and meet the wonder light in every eye as i go by endlinehere startlinehere each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze blinded by rainbow haze the stuff of happiness no less which wraps me in its glad hued folds of peacock golds endlinehere startlinehere before my feet the dusty rough paved way flushes beneath its gray endlinehere startlinehere my steps fall ringed with light so bright it seems a myriad suns are strown about the town endlinehere startlinehere around me is the sound of steepled bells and rich perfumed smells hang like a wind forgotten cloud and shroud me from close contact with the world endlinehere startlinehere you blazon me with jewelled insignia endlinehere startlinehere a flaming nebula rims in my life endlinehere startlinehere and yet you set the word upon me unconfessed to go unguessed endlinehere startlinehere i pray to be the tool which to your hand long use has shaped and moulded till it be apt for your need and unconsideringly you take it for its service endlinehere startlinehere i demand to be forgotten in the woven strand which grows the multi coloured tapestry of your bright life and through its tissues lie a hidden strong sustaining grey toned band endlinehere startlinehere i wish to dwell around your daylight dreams the railing to the stairway of the clouds to guard your steps securely up where streams a faery moonshine washing pale the crowds of pointed stars endlinehere startlinehere remember not whereby you mount protected to the far flung sky endlinehere startlinehere before me lies a mass of shapeless days unseparated atoms and i must sort them apart and live them endlinehere startlinehere sifted dust covers the formless heap endlinehere startlinehere reprieves delays there are none ever endlinehere startlinehere as a monk who prays the sliding beads asunder so i thrust each tasteless particle aside and just begin again the task which never stays endlinehere startlinehere and i have known a glory of great suns when days flashed by pulsing with joy and fire endlinehere startlinehere drunk bubbled wine in goblets of desire and felt the whipped blood laughing as it runs endlinehere startlinehere spilt is that liquor my too hasty hand threw down the cup and did not understand endlinehere startlinehere dearest forgive that with my clumsy touch i broke and bruised your rose endlinehere startlinehere i hardly could suppose it were a thing so fragile that my clutch could kill it thus endlinehere startlinehere it stood so proudly up upon its stem i knew no thought of fear and coming very near fell overbalanced to your garments hem tearing it down endlinehere startlinehere now stooping i upgather one by one the crimson petals all outspread about my fall endlinehere startlinehere they hold their fragrance still a blood red cone of memory endlinehere startlinehere and with my words i carve a little jar to keep their scented dust which opening you must breathe to your soul and breathing know me far more grieved than you endlinehere startlinehere an arid daylight shines along the beach dried to a grey monotony of tone and stranded jelly fish melt soft upon the sun baked pebbles far beyond their reach sparkles a wet reviving sea endlinehere startlinehere here bleach the skeletons of fishes every bone polished and stark like traceries of stone the joints and knuckles hardened each to each endlinehere startlinehere and they are dead while waiting for the sea the moon pursuing sea to come again endlinehere startlinehere their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze endlinehere startlinehere only the shells and stones can wait to be washed bright endlinehere startlinehere for living things who suffer pain may not endure till time can bring them ease endlinehere startlinehere happiness to some elation is to others mere stagnation endlinehere startlinehere days of passive somnolence at its wildest indolence endlinehere startlinehere hours of empty quietness no delight and no distress endlinehere startlinehere happiness to me is wine effervescent superfine endlinehere startlinehere full of tang and fiery pleasure far too hot to leave me leisure for a single thought beyond it endlinehere startlinehere this the bond it means to give ones soul to gain lifes quintessence endlinehere startlinehere even pain pricks to livelier living then wakes the nerves to laugh again raptures self is three parts sorrow endlinehere startlinehere although we must die to morrow losing every thought but this torn triumphant drowned in bliss endlinehere startlinehere happiness we rarely feel it endlinehere startlinehere how long shall i tarnish the mirror of life a spatter of rust on its polished steel endlinehere startlinehere the seasons reel like a goaded wheel endlinehere startlinehere half numb half maddened my days are strife endlinehere startlinehere the night is sliding towards the dawn and upturned hills crouch at autumns knees endlinehere startlinehere a torn moon flees through the hemlock trees the hours have gnawed it to feed their spawn endlinehere startlinehere pursuing and jeering the misshapen thing a rabble of clouds flares out of the east endlinehere startlinehere like dogs unleashed after a beast they stream on the sky an outflung string endlinehere startlinehere a desolate wind through the unpeopled dark shakes the bushes and whistles through empty nests and the fierce unrests i keep as guests crowd my brain with corpses pallid and stark endlinehere startlinehere leave me in peace o spectres who haunt my labouring mind i have fought and failed endlinehere startlinehere i have not quailed i was all unmailed and naked i strove tis my only vaunt endlinehere startlinehere the moon drops into the silver day as waking out of her swoon she comes endlinehere startlinehere i hear the drums of millenniums beating the mornings i still must stay endlinehere startlinehere the years i must watch go in and out while i build with water and dig in air and the trumpets blare hollow despair the shuddering trumpets of utter rout endlinehere startlinehere an atom tossed in a chaos made of yeasting worlds which bubble and foam endlinehere startlinehere whence have i come endlinehere startlinehere what would be home endlinehere startlinehere i hear no answer endlinehere startlinehere i crave to be lost like a wind blown flame endlinehere startlinehere pushed into nothingness by a breath and quench in a wreath of engulfing death this fight for a god or this devils game endlinehere startlinehere there once was a man whom the gods didnt love and a disagreeable man was he endlinehere startlinehere he loathed his neighbours and his neighbours hated him and he cursed eternally endlinehere startlinehere he damned the sun and he damned the stars and he blasted the winds in the sky endlinehere startlinehere he sent to hell every green growing thing and he raved at the birds as they fly endlinehere startlinehere his oaths were many and his range was wide he swore in fancy ways but his meaning was plain that no created thing was other than a hurt to his gaze endlinehere startlinehere he dwelt all alone underneath a leaning hill and windows toward the hill there were none and on the other side they were white washed thick to keep out every spark of the sun endlinehere startlinehere when he went to market he walked all the way blaspheming at the path he trod endlinehere startlinehere he cursed at those he bought of and swore at those he sold to by all the names he knew of god endlinehere startlinehere for his heart was soured in his weary old hide and his hopes had curdled in his breast endlinehere startlinehere his friend had been untrue and his love had thrown him over for the chinking money bags she liked best endlinehere startlinehere the rats had devoured the contents of his grain bin the deer had trampled on his corn his brook had shrivelled in a summer drought and his sheep had died unshorn endlinehere startlinehere his hens wouldnt lay and his cow broke loose and his old horse perished of a colic endlinehere startlinehere in the loft his wheat bags were nibbled into holes by little glutton mice on a frolic endlinehere startlinehere so he slowly lost all he ever had and the blood in his body dried endlinehere startlinehere shrunken and mean he still lived on and cursed that future which had lied endlinehere startlinehere so he dug and he delved with care and pain and the veins in his forehead stood taut endlinehere startlinehere at the end of an hour when every bone cracked he gathered up what he had sought endlinehere startlinehere a dim old vase of crusted glass prismed while it lay buried deep endlinehere startlinehere shifting reds and greens like a pigeons neck at the touch of the sun began to leap endlinehere startlinehere it was dull in the tree shade but glowing in the light flashing like an opal stone carved into a flagon and the colours glanced and ran where at first there had seemed to be none endlinehere startlinehere it had handles on each side to bear it up and a belly for the gurgling wine endlinehere startlinehere its neck was slender and its mouth was wide and its lip was curled and fine endlinehere startlinehere then he carried it home and put it on a shelf but it was only grey in the gloom endlinehere startlinehere so he fetched a pail and a bit of cloth and he went outside with a broom endlinehere startlinehere the old man forgot to swear watching its shadow grown a mammoth size dancing in the kitchen there endlinehere startlinehere he forgot to revile the sun next morning when he found his vase afire in its light endlinehere startlinehere and he carried it out of the house that day and kept it close beside him until night endlinehere startlinehere and so it happened from day to day endlinehere startlinehere the old man fed his life on the beauty of his vase on its perfect shape endlinehere startlinehere and his soul forgot its former strife endlinehere startlinehere and the village folk came and begged to see the flagon which was dug from the ground endlinehere startlinehere and the old man never thought of an oath in his joy at showing what he had found endlinehere startlinehere one day the master of the village school passed him as he stooped at toil hoeing for a bean row and at his side was the vase on the turned up soil endlinehere startlinehere my friend said the schoolmaster pompous and kind thats a valuable thing you have there but it might get broken out of doors it should meet with the utmost care endlinehere startlinehere what are you doing with it out here endlinehere startlinehere why sir said the poor old man i like to have it about do you see endlinehere startlinehere to be with it all i can endlinehere startlinehere you will smash it said the schoolmaster sternly right mark my words and see endlinehere startlinehere and he walked away while the old man looked at his treasure despondingly endlinehere startlinehere then he smiled to himself for it was his endlinehere startlinehere he had toiled for it and now he cared endlinehere startlinehere loved its shape and its subtle swift hues which his own hard work had bared endlinehere startlinehere he would carry it round with him everywhere as it gave him joy to do endlinehere startlinehere a fragile vase should not stand in a bean row endlinehere startlinehere who would dare to say so endlinehere startlinehere then his heart was rested and his fears gave way and he bent to his hoe again endlinehere startlinehere a clod rolled down and his foot slipped back and he lurched with a cry of pain endlinehere startlinehere for the blade of the hoe crashed into glass and the vase fell to iridescent sherds endlinehere startlinehere the old mans body heaved with slow dry sobs endlinehere startlinehere he did not curse he had no words endlinehere startlinehere he gathered the fragments one by one and his fingers were cut and torn endlinehere startlinehere then he made a hole in the very place whence the beautiful vase had been borne endlinehere startlinehere he covered the hole and he patted it down then he hobbled to his house and shut the door endlinehere startlinehere he tore up his coat and nailed it at the windows that no beam of light should cross the floor endlinehere startlinehere he sat down in front of the empty hearth and he neither ate nor drank endlinehere startlinehere in three days they found him dead and cold and they said what a queer old crank endlinehere startlinehere have at you you devils endlinehere startlinehere my backs to this tree for youre nothing so nice that the hind side of me would escape your assault endlinehere startlinehere come on now all three endlinehere startlinehere heres a dandified gentleman rapier at point and a wrist which whirls round like a circular joint endlinehere startlinehere thats just to anoint and make supple your limbs endlinehere startlinehere tis a pity the silk of your waistcoat is stained endlinehere startlinehere your hearts full of milk and so full it spills over endlinehere startlinehere im not of your ilk endlinehere startlinehere you said so and laughed at my old fashioned hose at the cut of my hair at the length of my nose endlinehere startlinehere to carve it to pattern i think you propose endlinehere startlinehere your pardon young sir but my nose and my sword are proving themselves in quite perfect accord endlinehere startlinehere i grieve to have spotted your shirt endlinehere startlinehere that blades not a stick to slash right and left and my skull is too thick to be cleft with such cuffs of a sword endlinehere startlinehere now a lick down the side of your face endlinehere startlinehere what a pretty red line endlinehere startlinehere tell the taverns that scar was an honour endlinehere startlinehere dont whine that a stranger has marked you endlinehere startlinehere the trees there you swine endlinehere startlinehere did you think to get in at the back while your friends made a little diversion in front endlinehere startlinehere so it ends with your sword clattering down on the ground endlinehere startlinehere tis amends i make for your courteous reception of me a foreigner landed from over the sea endlinehere startlinehere your welcome was fervent i think youll agree endlinehere startlinehere my shoes are not buckled with gold nor my hair oiled and scented my jackets not satin i wear corded breeches wide hats and i make people stare endlinehere startlinehere so i do but my heart is the heart of a man and my thoughts cannot twirl in the limited span twixt my head and my heels as some other mens can endlinehere startlinehere i have business more strange than the shape of my boots and my interests range from the sky to the roots of this dung hill you live in you half rotted shoots of a mouldering tree endlinehere startlinehere heres at you once more endlinehere startlinehere you can show me the door and jeer at my ways but youre pinked to the core endlinehere startlinehere and before i have done i will prick my name in with the front of my steel and your lily white skin shall be printed with me endlinehere startlinehere for ive come here to win endlinehere startlinehere my cup is empty to night cold and dry are its sides chilled by the wind from the open window endlinehere startlinehere empty and void it sparkles white in the moonlight endlinehere startlinehere the room is filled with the strange scent of wistaria blossoms endlinehere startlinehere they sway in the moons radiance and tap against the wall endlinehere startlinehere but the cup of my heart is still and cold and empty endlinehere startlinehere when you come it brims red and trembling with blood hearts blood for your drinking to fill your mouth with love and the bitter sweet taste of a soul endlinehere startlinehere my words are little jars for you to take and put upon a shelf endlinehere startlinehere their shapes are quaint and beautiful and they have many pleasant colours and lustres to recommend them endlinehere startlinehere also the scent from them fills the room with sweetness of flowers and crushed grasses endlinehere startlinehere you glow in my heart like the flames of uncounted candles endlinehere startlinehere but when i go to warm my hands my clumsiness overturns the light and then i stumble against the tables and chairs endlinehere startlinehere outside the long window with his head on the stone sill the dog is lying gazing at his beloved endlinehere startlinehere his eyes are wet and urgent and his body is taut and shaking endlinehere startlinehere it is cold on the terrace a pale wind licks along the stone slabs but the dog gazes through the glass and is content endlinehere startlinehere the beloved is writing a letter endlinehere startlinehere occasionally she speaks to the dog but she is thinking of her writing endlinehere startlinehere does she too give her devotion to one not worthy endlinehere startlinehere licking passions have bitten their arabesques into it and the mark of them lies in and out worm like with the beauty of corroded copper patterning white steel endlinehere startlinehere my brain is curved like a scimitar and sighs at its cutting like a sickle mowing grass endlinehere startlinehere but of what use is all this to me endlinehere startlinehere i who am set to crack stones in a country lane endlinehere startlinehere my heart is like a cleft pomegranate bleeding crimson seeds and dripping them on the ground endlinehere startlinehere my heart gapes because it is ripe and over full and its seeds are bursting from it endlinehere startlinehere but how is this other than a torment to me endlinehere startlinehere i who am shut up with broken crockery in a dark closet endlinehere startlinehere i have been temperate always but i am like to be very drunk with your coming endlinehere startlinehere there have been times i feared to walk down the street lest i should reel with the wine of you and jerk against my neighbours as they go by endlinehere startlinehere i will mix me a drink of stars large stars with polychrome needles small stars jetting maroon and crimson cool quiet green stars endlinehere startlinehere it will lap and scratch as i swallow it down and i shall feel it as a serpent of fire coiling and twisting in my belly endlinehere startlinehere the rain gullies the garden paths and tinkles on the broad sides of grass blades endlinehere startlinehere a tree at the end of my arm is hazy with mist endlinehere startlinehere even so i can see that it has red berries a scarlet fruit filmed over with moisture endlinehere startlinehere it seems as though the rain dripping from it should be tinged with colour endlinehere startlinehere i desire the berries but in the mist i only scratch my hand on the thorns endlinehere startlinehere probably too they are bitter endlinehere startlinehere hold your apron wide that i may pour my gifts into it so that scarcely shall your two arms hinder them from falling to the ground endlinehere startlinehere i would pour them upon you and cover you for greatly do i feel this need of giving you something even these poor things endlinehere startlinehere dearest of my heart endlinehere startlinehere when i go away from you the world beats dead like a slackened drum endlinehere startlinehere i call out for you against the jutted stars and shout into the ridges of the wind endlinehere startlinehere streets coming fast one after the other wedge you away from me and the lamps of the city prick my eyes so that i can no longer see your face endlinehere startlinehere why should i leave you to wound myself upon the sharp edges of the night endlinehere startlinehere hold your soul open for my welcoming endlinehere startlinehere let the quiet of your spirit bathe me with its clear and rippled coolness that loose limbed and weary i find rest outstretched upon your peace as on a bed of ivory endlinehere startlinehere between us leapt a gold and scarlet flame endlinehere startlinehere into the hollow of the cupped arched blue of heaven it rose endlinehere startlinehere its flickering tongues up drew and vanished in the sunshine endlinehere startlinehere how it came we guessed not nor what thing could be its name endlinehere startlinehere from each to each had sprung those sparks which flew together into fire endlinehere startlinehere but we knew the winds would slap and quench it in their game endlinehere startlinehere and so we graved and fashioned marble blocks to treasure it and placed them round about endlinehere startlinehere with pillared porticos we wreathed the whole and roofed it with bright bronze endlinehere startlinehere behind carved locks flowered the tall and sheltered flame endlinehere startlinehere without the baffled winds thrust at a columns bole endlinehere startlinehere beneath this sod lie the remains of one who died of growing pains endlinehere startlinehere you ask me for a sonnet endlinehere startlinehere ah my dear can clocks tick back to yesterday at noon endlinehere startlinehere can cracked and fallen leaves recall last june and leap up on the boughs now stiff and sere endlinehere startlinehere yes tis that endlinehere startlinehere my shadow stretches forward and the ground is dark in front because the lights behind endlinehere startlinehere it is grotesque with such a funny hat in watching it and walking i have found more than enough to occupy my mind endlinehere startlinehere i cannot turn the light would make me blind endlinehere startlinehere a yellow band of light upon the street pours from an open door and makes a wide pathway of bright gold across a sheet of calm and liquid moonshine endlinehere startlinehere from inside come shouts and streams of laughter and a snatch of song soon drowned and lost again in mirth the clip of tankards on a table top and stir of booted heels endlinehere startlinehere against the patch of candle light a shadow falls its girth proclaims the host himself and master of his shop endlinehere startlinehere this is the tavern of one hilverdink jan hilverdink whose wines are much esteemed endlinehere startlinehere within his cellar men can have to drink the rarest cordials old monks ever schemed to coax from pulpy grapes and with nice art improve and spice their virgin juiciness endlinehere startlinehere here froths the amber beer of many a brew crowning each pewter tankard with as smart a cap as ever in his wantonness winter set glittering on top of an old yew endlinehere startlinehere tall candles stand upon the table where are twisted glasses ruby sparked with wine clarets and ports endlinehere startlinehere those topaz bumpers were drained from slim long necked bottles of the rhine endlinehere startlinehere the centre of the board is piled with pipes slender and clean the still unbaptized clay awaits its burning fate endlinehere startlinehere behind the vault stretches from dim to dark a groping way bordered by casks and puncheons whose brass stripes and bands gleam dully still beyond the gay tumult endlinehere startlinehere for good old master hilverdink a toast endlinehere startlinehere clamoured a youth with tassels on his boots endlinehere startlinehere bring out your oldest brandy for a boast from that small barrel in the very roots of your deep cellar man endlinehere startlinehere why here is max endlinehere startlinehere welcome max youre scarcely here in time endlinehere startlinehere we want to drink to old jans luck and smoke his best tobacco for a grand climax endlinehere startlinehere here jan a paper fragrant as crushed thyme well have the best to wish you luck or may we choke endlinehere startlinehere max breuck unclasped his broadcloth cloak and sat endlinehere startlinehere well thought of franz heres luck to mynheer jan endlinehere startlinehere the host set down a jar then to a vat lost in the distance of his cellar ran endlinehere startlinehere max took a pipe as graceful as the stem of some long tulip crammed it full and drew the pungent smoke deep to his grateful lung endlinehere startlinehere it curled all blue throughout the cave and flew into the silver night endlinehere startlinehere at once there flung into the crowded shop a boy who cried to them oh sirs is there some learned lawyer here some advocate or all wise counsellor endlinehere startlinehere my master sent me to inquire where such men do mostly be but every door was shut and barred for late has grown the hour endlinehere startlinehere i pray you tell me where i may now find one versed in law the matter will not wait endlinehere startlinehere i am a lawyer boy said max my mind is not locked to my business though tis late endlinehere startlinehere i shall be glad to serve what way is in my power endlinehere startlinehere then once more cloaked and ready he set out tripping the footsteps of the eager boy along the dappled cobbles while the rout within the tavern jeered at his employ endlinehere startlinehere through new burst elm leaves filtered the white moon who peered and splashed between the twinkling boughs flooded the open spaces and took flight before tall serried houses in platoon guarded by shadows endlinehere startlinehere past the custom house they took their hurried way in the spring scented night endlinehere startlinehere before a door which fronted a canal the boy halted endlinehere startlinehere a dim tree shaded spot endlinehere startlinehere the water lapped the stones in musical and rhythmic tappings and a galliot slumbered at anchor with no light aboard endlinehere startlinehere the boy knocked twice and steps approached endlinehere startlinehere a flame winked through the keyhole then a key was turned and through the open door max went toward another door whence sound of voices came endlinehere startlinehere he entered a large room where candelabra burned endlinehere startlinehere an aged man in quilted dressing gown rose up to greet him endlinehere startlinehere sir said max you sent your messenger to seek throughout the town a lawyer endlinehere startlinehere i have small accomplishment but i am at your service and my name is max breuck counsellor at your command endlinehere startlinehere mynheer replied the aged man obliged am i and count myself much privileged endlinehere startlinehere i am cornelius kurler and my fame is better known on distant oceans than on land endlinehere startlinehere my ship has tasted water in strange seas and bartered goods at still uncharted isles endlinehere startlinehere shes oft coquetted with a tropic breeze and sheered off hurricanes with jaunty smiles endlinehere startlinehere tush kurler here broke in the other man enough of poetry draw the deed and sign endlinehere startlinehere the old man seemed to wizen at the voice my good friend grootver he at once began endlinehere startlinehere no introductions let us have some wine and business now that you at last have made your choice endlinehere startlinehere a harsh and disagreeable man he proved to be this grootver with no single kindly thought endlinehere startlinehere kurler explained his old hands nervously twisting his beard endlinehere startlinehere his vessel he had bought from grootver endlinehere startlinehere little by little max made out the way that grootver pressed that poor harassed old man endlinehere startlinehere his money he must have too long delay had turned the usurer to a ruffian endlinehere startlinehere such light and foamy silks like crinkled cream and indigo more blue than sun whipped seas spices and fragrant trees a massive beam of sandalwood and pungent china teas tobacco coffee endlinehere startlinehere grootver only laughed endlinehere startlinehere max heard it all and worse than all he heard the deed to which the sailor gave his word endlinehere startlinehere he shivered twas as if the villain gaffed the old man with a boat hook bleeding spent he begged for life nor knew at all the road he went endlinehere startlinehere for kurler had a daughter young and gay carefully reared and shielded rarely seen endlinehere startlinehere but on one black and most unfriendly day grootver had caught her as she passed between the kitchen and the garden endlinehere startlinehere she had run in fear of him his evil leering eye and when he came she bolted in her room refused to show though gave no reason why endlinehere startlinehere the spinning of her future had begun on quiet nights she heard the whirring of her doom endlinehere startlinehere max mended an old goosequill by the fire loathing his work but seeing no thing to do endlinehere startlinehere he felt his hands were building up the pyre to burn two souls and seized with vertigo he staggered to his chair endlinehere startlinehere before him lay white paper still unspotted by a crime endlinehere startlinehere now young man write said grootver in his ear endlinehere startlinehere if in two years my vessel should yet stay from amsterdam i give grootver sometime a friend my daughter for his lawful wife endlinehere startlinehere and kurler swore a palsied tottering sound and traced his name a shaking wandering line endlinehere startlinehere then dazed he sat there speechless from his wound endlinehere startlinehere grootver got up fair voyage the brigantine endlinehere startlinehere he shuffled from the room and left the house endlinehere startlinehere his footsteps wore to silence down the street endlinehere startlinehere at last the aged man began to rouse endlinehere startlinehere with help he once more gained his trembling feet endlinehere startlinehere my daughter mynheer breuck is friendless now endlinehere startlinehere will you watch over her endlinehere startlinehere i ask a solemn vow endlinehere startlinehere max laid his hand upon the old mans arm before god sir i vow when you are gone so to protect your daughter from all harm as one man may endlinehere startlinehere thus sorrowful forlorn the situation to max breuck appeared he gave his promise almost without thought nor looked to see a difficulty endlinehere startlinehere bred gently to watch a mother left alone bound by a dying fathers wish who feared the worlds accustomed harshness when he should be dead such was my case from youth mynheer kurler endlinehere startlinehere last winter she died also and my days are passed in work lest i should grieve for her and undo habits used to earn her praise endlinehere startlinehere my leisure i will gladly give to see your household and your daughter prosperous endlinehere startlinehere the sailor said his thanks but turned away endlinehere startlinehere he could not brook that his humility so little wonted and so tremulous should first before a stranger make such great display endlinehere startlinehere come here to morrow as the bells ring noon i sail at the full sea my daughter then i will make known to you endlinehere startlinehere twill be a boon if after i have bid good by and when her eyeballs scorch with watching me depart you bring her home again endlinehere startlinehere she lives with one old serving woman who has brought her up endlinehere startlinehere but that is no friend for so free a heart endlinehere startlinehere no head to match her questions endlinehere startlinehere it is done endlinehere startlinehere and i must sail away to come and brim her cup endlinehere startlinehere my ships the fastest that owns amsterdam as home so not a letter can you send endlinehere startlinehere i shall be back before to where i am another ship could reach endlinehere startlinehere now your stipend quickly breuck interposed endlinehere startlinehere when you once more tread on the stones which pave our streets endlinehere startlinehere to morrow i will be at stroke of noon at the great wharf endlinehere startlinehere then hurrying in spite of cake and wine the old man pressed upon him ere he went he took his leave and shut the door endlinehere startlinehere twas noon in amsterdam the day was clear and sunshine tipped the pointed roofs with gold endlinehere startlinehere the brown canals ran liquid bronze for here the sun sank deep into the waters cold endlinehere startlinehere and every clock and belfry in the town hammered and struck and rang endlinehere startlinehere such peals of bells to shake the sunny morning into life and to proclaim the middle and the crown of this most sparkling daytime endlinehere startlinehere the crowd swells laughing and pushing toward the quays in friendly strife endlinehere startlinehere the horn of fortune sails away to day endlinehere startlinehere at highest tide she lets her anchor go and starts for china endlinehere startlinehere giddy in freshest paint she curtseys low and beckons to her boats to let her start endlinehere startlinehere blue is the ocean with a flashing breeze endlinehere startlinehere the shining waves are quick to take her part endlinehere startlinehere they push and spatter her endlinehere startlinehere her sails are loose her tackles hanging waiting men to seize and haul them taut with chanty singing as they choose endlinehere startlinehere at the great wharfs edge mynheer kurler stands and by his side his daughter young christine endlinehere startlinehere max breuck is there his hat held in his hands bowing before them both endlinehere startlinehere the brigantine bounces impatient at the long delay curvets and jumps a cables length from shore endlinehere startlinehere a heavy galliot unloads on the walls round yellow cheeses like gold cannon balls stacked on the stones in pyramids endlinehere startlinehere once more kurler has kissed christine and now he is away endlinehere startlinehere christine stood rigid like a frozen stone her hands wrung pale in effort at control endlinehere startlinehere max moved aside and let her be alone for grief exacts each penny of its toll endlinehere startlinehere the dancing boat tossed on the glinting sea endlinehere startlinehere a sun path swallowed it in flaming light then shrunk a cockleshell it came again upon the other side endlinehere startlinehere now on the lee it took the horn of fortune endlinehere startlinehere straining sight could see it hauled aboard men pulling on the crane endlinehere startlinehere then up above the eager brigantine along her slender masts the sails took flight were sheeted home and ropes were coiled endlinehere startlinehere the shine of the wet anchor when its heavy weight rose splashing to the deck endlinehere startlinehere these things they saw christine and max upon the crowded quay endlinehere startlinehere they saw the sails grow white then blue in shade the ship had turned caught in a windy flaw she glided imperceptibly away drew farther off and in the bright sky seemed to fade endlinehere startlinehere home through the emptying streets max took christine who would have hid her sorrow from his gaze endlinehere startlinehere before the iron gateway clasped between each garden wall he stopped endlinehere startlinehere she in amaze asked do you enter not then mynheer breuck endlinehere startlinehere my father told me of your courtesy endlinehere startlinehere since i am now your charge tis meet for me to show such hospitality as maiden may without disdaining rules must not be broke endlinehere startlinehere katrina will have coffee and she bakes today endlinehere startlinehere she straight unhasped the tall beflowered gate endlinehere startlinehere max started at the beauty at the glare of tints endlinehere startlinehere at either end was set a wide path strewn with fine red gravel and such shows of tulips in their splendour flaunted everywhere endlinehere startlinehere from side to side midway each path there ran a longer one which cut the space in two endlinehere startlinehere then the dame katrina shook them down in pelting showers they plunged to earth and died transformed to sugared food endlinehere startlinehere against the high encircling walls were grapes nailed close to feel the baking of the sun from glowing bricks endlinehere startlinehere their microscopic shapes half hidden by serrated leaves endlinehere startlinehere and one old cherry tossed its branches near the door endlinehere startlinehere bordered along the wall in beds between flickering streaming nodding in the air the pride of all the garden there were more tulips than max had ever dreamed or seen endlinehere startlinehere they jostled mobbed and danced endlinehere startlinehere max stood at helpless stare endlinehere startlinehere within the arbour mynheer breuck ill bring coffee and cakes a pipe and fathers best tobacco brought from countries harbouring dawns earliest footstep endlinehere startlinehere with girlish zest to please her guest she flew endlinehere startlinehere a moment more she came again with her old nurse behind endlinehere startlinehere then sitting on the bench and knitting fast she talked as someone with a noble store of hidden fancies blown upon the wind eager to flutter forth and leave their silent past endlinehere startlinehere the little apple leaves above their heads let fall a quivering sunshine endlinehere startlinehere quiet cool in blossomed boughs they sat endlinehere startlinehere beyond the beds of tulips blazed a proper vestibule and antechamber to the rainbow endlinehere startlinehere dyes of prismed richness carmine endlinehere startlinehere blues tinging dark browns to purple endlinehere startlinehere silvers flushed to amethyst and tinct with gold endlinehere startlinehere round eyes of scarlet spotting tender saffron hues endlinehere startlinehere violets sunk to blacks and reds in orange crushed endlinehere startlinehere of every pattern and in every shade endlinehere startlinehere nacreous iridescent mottled checked endlinehere startlinehere some purest sulphur yellow others made an ivory white with disks of copper flecked endlinehere startlinehere sprinkled and striped tasselled or keenest edged endlinehere startlinehere striated powdered freckled long or short endlinehere startlinehere they bloomed and seemed strange wonder moths new fledged born of the spectrum wedded to a flame endlinehere startlinehere the shade within the arbour made a port to oertaxed eyes its still green twilight rest became endlinehere startlinehere her knitting needles clicked and christine talked this child matured to woman unaware the first time left alone endlinehere startlinehere now dreams once balked found utterance endlinehere startlinehere max thought her very fair endlinehere startlinehere beneath her cap her ornaments shone gold and purest gold they were endlinehere startlinehere kurler was rich and heedful endlinehere startlinehere her old maiden aunt had died whose darling care she was endlinehere startlinehere now growing bold she asked had max a sister endlinehere startlinehere dropped a stitch at her own candour endlinehere startlinehere then she paused and softly sighed endlinehere startlinehere two years was long endlinehere startlinehere she loved her father well but fears she had not endlinehere startlinehere he had always been just sailed or sailing endlinehere startlinehere and she must not dwell on sad thoughts he had told her so and seen her smile at parting endlinehere startlinehere but she sighed once more endlinehere startlinehere two years was long twas not one hour yet endlinehere startlinehere mynheer grootver she would not see at all endlinehere startlinehere yes yes she knew but ere the date so set the horn of fortune would be at the wall endlinehere startlinehere when max had bid farewell she watched him from the door endlinehere startlinehere such things were christines world and his was she winter drew near his sun was in her smiles endlinehere startlinehere another spring and at his law he toiled unspoken hope counselled a wise efficiency endlinehere startlinehere max breuck was honours soul he knew himself the guardian of this girl no more no less endlinehere startlinehere as one in charge of guineas on a shelf loose in a china teapot may confess his need but may not borrow till his friend comes back to give endlinehere startlinehere so max in honour said no word of love or marriage but the days he clipped off on his almanac endlinehere startlinehere the end must come endlinehere startlinehere the second year with feet of lead lagged slowly by till spring had plumped the willow sprays endlinehere startlinehere two years had made christine a woman grown with dignity and gently certain pride endlinehere startlinehere but all her childhood fancies had not flown her thoughts in lovely dreamings seemed to glide endlinehere startlinehere max was her trusted friend did she confess a closer happiness endlinehere startlinehere max could not tell endlinehere startlinehere two years were over and his life he found sphered and complete endlinehere startlinehere in restless eagerness he waited for the horn of fortune endlinehere startlinehere well had he his promise kept abating not one pound endlinehere startlinehere spring slipped away to summer endlinehere startlinehere still no glass sighted the brigantine endlinehere startlinehere then grootver came demanding jufvrouw kurler endlinehere startlinehere his trespass was justified for he had won the game endlinehere startlinehere christine begged time more time endlinehere startlinehere midsummer went and grootver waxed impatient endlinehere startlinehere still the ship tarried endlinehere startlinehere christine betrayed and weary sank to dreadful terrors endlinehere startlinehere one day crazed she sent for max endlinehere startlinehere come quickly said her note i skip the worst distress until we meet endlinehere startlinehere the world is blank endlinehere startlinehere through the long sunshine of late afternoon max went to her endlinehere startlinehere in the pleached alley lost in bitter reverie he found her soon endlinehere startlinehere and sitting down beside her at the cost of all his secret dear said he what thing so suddenly has happened endlinehere startlinehere then in tears she told that grootver on the following morn would come to marry her and shuddering i will die rather death has lesser fears endlinehere startlinehere max felt the shackles drop from the oath which he had sworn endlinehere startlinehere my dearest one the hid joy of my heart endlinehere startlinehere i love you oh endlinehere startlinehere you must indeed have known endlinehere startlinehere in strictest honour i have played my part but all this misery has overthrown my scruples endlinehere startlinehere if you love me marry me before the sun has dipped behind those trees endlinehere startlinehere you cannot be wed twice and grootver foiled can eat his anger endlinehere startlinehere my care it shall be to pay your fathers debt by such degrees as i can compass and for years ive greatly toiled endlinehere startlinehere this is not haste christine for long ive known my love and silence forced upon my lips endlinehere startlinehere i worship you with all the strength ive shown in keeping faith endlinehere startlinehere with pleading finger tips he touched her arm endlinehere startlinehere dearest speak i love you endlinehere startlinehere do my words fall too swift now endlinehere startlinehere theyve been in leash so long upon the brink endlinehere startlinehere she sat quite still her body loose and weak endlinehere startlinehere then into him she melted all her soul at flow endlinehere startlinehere and they were married ere the westering sun had disappeared behind the garden trees endlinehere startlinehere the evening poured on them its benison and flower scents that only night time frees rose up around them from the beamy ground silvered and shadowed by a tranquil moon endlinehere startlinehere within the arbour long they lay embraced in such enraptured sweetness as they found close partnered each to each and thinking soon to be enwoven long ere night to morning faced endlinehere startlinehere then far spent our eyes will close to undisturbed rest endlinehere startlinehere for that desired thing i leave you now endlinehere startlinehere to pinnacle this days accomplishment by telling grootver that a bootless quest is his and that his schemes have met a knock down blow endlinehere startlinehere but christine clung to him with sobbing cries pleading for loves sake that he leave her not endlinehere startlinehere and wound her arms about his knees and thighs as he stood over her endlinehere startlinehere with dread begot of grootvers name and silence and the night she shook and trembled endlinehere startlinehere words in moaning plaint wooed him to stay endlinehere startlinehere she feared she knew not why yet greatly feared endlinehere startlinehere she seemed some anguished saint martyred by visions endlinehere startlinehere max breuck soothed her fright with wisdom then stepped out under the cooling sky endlinehere startlinehere but at the gate once more she held him close and quenched her heart again upon his lips endlinehere startlinehere my sweetheart why this terror endlinehere startlinehere i propose but to be gone one hour endlinehere startlinehere evening slips away this errand must be done endlinehere startlinehere first goes my father if i lose you now endlinehere startlinehere she grasped him as in panic lest she drown endlinehere startlinehere softly he laughed one hour through the town by moonlight endlinehere startlinehere thats no place for foul attacks endlinehere startlinehere dearest be comforted and clear that troubled brow endlinehere startlinehere one hour dear and then no more alone endlinehere startlinehere we front another day as man and wife endlinehere startlinehere i shall be back almost before im gone and midnight shall anoint and crown our life endlinehere startlinehere then through the gate he passed endlinehere startlinehere along the street she watched his buttons gleaming in the moon endlinehere startlinehere he stopped to wave and turned the garden wall endlinehere startlinehere straight she sank down upon a mossy seat endlinehere startlinehere her senses mist encircled by a swoon swayed to unconsciousness beneath its wreathing pall endlinehere startlinehere briskly max walked beside the still canal endlinehere startlinehere his step was firm with purpose endlinehere startlinehere not a jot he feared this meeting nor the rancorous gall grootver would spit on him who marred his plot endlinehere startlinehere he dreaded no man since he could protect christine endlinehere startlinehere he stopped and laughed aloud endlinehere startlinehere his starved life had not fitted him for joy endlinehere startlinehere it strained him to the utmost to reject even this hour with her endlinehere startlinehere his heart beat loud endlinehere startlinehere damn grootver who can force my time to this employ endlinehere startlinehere what boyish uncontrol to be so racked endlinehere startlinehere then felt his ticking watch endlinehere startlinehere in half an hour grootver would know the whole endlinehere startlinehere and he would be returned lifting the latch of his own gate eager to take christine and crush her to his lips endlinehere startlinehere how bear delay endlinehere startlinehere he broke into a run endlinehere startlinehere in front a line of candle light banded the cobbled street endlinehere startlinehere not for many a day had he been there to take his old accustomed seat endlinehere startlinehere and out they came pell mell his old companions endlinehere startlinehere max where have you been endlinehere startlinehere not drink with us endlinehere startlinehere indeed you serve us well endlinehere startlinehere how many months is it since we have seen you here endlinehere startlinehere jan jan you slow old doddering goat endlinehere startlinehere heres mynheer breuck come back again at last stir your old bones to welcome him endlinehere startlinehere fill your throat heres beer or brandy endlinehere startlinehere now boys hold him fast endlinehere startlinehere put down your cane dear man endlinehere startlinehere what really vicious whacks endlinehere startlinehere they forced him to a seat and held him there despite his anger while the hideous joke was tossed from hand to hand endlinehere startlinehere franz poured with care a brimming glass of whiskey endlinehere startlinehere here weve broke into a virgin barrel for you drink endlinehere startlinehere married and out on business endlinehere startlinehere which lies the likeliest endlinehere startlinehere come max do think endlinehere startlinehere swollen with fury struggling with these men max cursed hilarity which must needs have a mark endlinehere startlinehere forcing himself to steadiness he tried to quell the uproar told them what he dared of his own life and circumstance endlinehere startlinehere implied most urgent matters time could ill be spared endlinehere startlinehere in jesting mood his comrades heard his tale and scoffed at it endlinehere startlinehere he felt his anger more goaded and bursting cowards endlinehere startlinehere is no one loth to mock at duty here they called for ale and forced a pipe upon him endlinehere startlinehere with an oath he shivered it to fragments on the earthen floor endlinehere startlinehere sobered a little by his violence and by the host who begged them to be still nor injure his good name max no offence they blurted you may leave now if you will endlinehere startlinehere weve gone too far endlinehere startlinehere i ask your pardon for our foolish joke endlinehere startlinehere it started in a wager ere you came endlinehere startlinehere the talk somehow had falln on drugs a jar i brought from china herbs the natives smoke was with me and i thought merely to play a game endlinehere startlinehere its properties are to induce a sleep fraught with adventure and the flight of time is inconceivable in swiftness endlinehere startlinehere deep sunken in slumber imageries sublime flatter the senses or some fearful dream holds them enmeshed endlinehere startlinehere years pass which on the clock are but so many seconds endlinehere startlinehere we agreed that the next man who came should prove the scheme and you were he endlinehere startlinehere and then the pipe was broke and you were freed endlinehere startlinehere max breuck was maddened now endlinehere startlinehere another jest of your befuddled wits endlinehere startlinehere i know not why i am to be your butt endlinehere startlinehere at my request youll choose among you one wholl answer for your most unseasonable mirth endlinehere startlinehere youll hear from me endlinehere startlinehere but franz had caught him at the very door it is no lie max breuck and for your plight i am to blame endlinehere startlinehere come back and well talk quietly endlinehere startlinehere you have no business that is why we laughed since you had none a few minutes ago endlinehere startlinehere as to your wedding naturally we chaffed knowing the length of time it takes to do a simple thing like that in this slow world endlinehere startlinehere indeed max twas a dream endlinehere startlinehere forgive me then endlinehere startlinehere ill burn the drug if you prefer endlinehere startlinehere but breuck muttered and stared a lie endlinehere startlinehere and then he hurled distraught this word at franz prove it endlinehere startlinehere and when its proven ill believe endlinehere startlinehere that thing shall be your work endlinehere startlinehere ill give you just one week to make your case endlinehere startlinehere on august thirty first eighteen fourteen i shall require your proof endlinehere startlinehere with wondering face franz cried a week to august and fourteen the year endlinehere startlinehere youre mad tis april now endlinehere startlinehere april and eighteen twelve endlinehere startlinehere max staggered caught a chair april two years ago endlinehere startlinehere indeed or you or i are mad endlinehere startlinehere i know not how either could blunder so endlinehere startlinehere hilverdink brought the amsterdam gazette and max was forced to read endlinehere startlinehere eighteen hundred and twelve in largest print and next to it april the twenty first endlinehere startlinehere the letters smeared and jumbled but by dint of straining every nerve to meet the worst he read it and into his pounding brain tumbled a horror endlinehere startlinehere like a roaring sea foreboding shipwreck came the message plain this is two years ago endlinehere startlinehere what of christine endlinehere startlinehere he fled the cellar in his agony running to outstrip fate and save his holy shrine endlinehere startlinehere the darkened buildings echoed to his feet clap clapping on the pavement as he ran endlinehere startlinehere across moon misted squares clamoured his fleet and terror winged steps endlinehere startlinehere his heart began to labour at the speed endlinehere startlinehere and still no sign no flutter of a leaf against the sky endlinehere startlinehere and this should be the garden wall and round the corner the old gate endlinehere startlinehere no even line was this endlinehere startlinehere and then a fearful cry shattered the stillness endlinehere startlinehere two stiff houses filled the ground endlinehere startlinehere shoulder to shoulder like dragoons in line they stood and max knew them to be the ones to right and left of kurlers garden endlinehere startlinehere spine rigid next frozen spine endlinehere startlinehere no mellow tones of ancient gilded iron undulate expanding in wide circles and broad curves the twisted iron of the garden gate was there endlinehere startlinehere the houses touched and left no space between endlinehere startlinehere with glassy eyes and shaking nerves max gazed endlinehere startlinehere then mad with fear fled still and left that place endlinehere startlinehere stumbling and panting on he ran and on endlinehere startlinehere his slobbering lips could only cry christine endlinehere startlinehere where are you gone endlinehere startlinehere what future is our past endlinehere startlinehere what saturnine sardonic devils jest has bid us live two years together in a puff of smoke endlinehere startlinehere it was no dream i swear it endlinehere startlinehere in some star or still imprisoned in times egg you give me love endlinehere startlinehere dearest dear this stroke shall never part us i will reach to where you are endlinehere startlinehere his burning eyeballs stared into the dark endlinehere startlinehere the moon had long been set endlinehere startlinehere and still he cried christine endlinehere startlinehere his youth had taught their meaning now they closed upon his dream endlinehere startlinehere softly he knocked against the casement wide it flew and a cracked voice his business there demanded endlinehere startlinehere the door opened and inside max stepped endlinehere startlinehere he saw a candle held in air above the head of a gray bearded jew endlinehere startlinehere simeon isaacs mynheer can i serve you endlinehere startlinehere do you keep arms endlinehere startlinehere i want a pistol endlinehere startlinehere quick the old man grew livid endlinehere startlinehere mynheer a pistol endlinehere startlinehere let me swerve you from your purpose endlinehere startlinehere life brings often false alarms peace good old isaacs why should you suppose my purpose deadly endlinehere startlinehere in good truth ive been blest above others endlinehere startlinehere you have many rows of pistols it would seem endlinehere startlinehere here this shagreen case holds one that i fancy endlinehere startlinehere silvered mounts are to my taste endlinehere startlinehere twill serve my turn though hastily he counts the florins down upon the table endlinehere startlinehere well good night and wish me luck for your to morrows toast endlinehere startlinehere into the night again he hurried now pale and in haste and far beyond the town he set his goal endlinehere startlinehere and then he wondered how poor c endlinehere startlinehere had come to die endlinehere startlinehere its grown handy in killing maybe this ive bought and will work punctually endlinehere startlinehere his sorrow fell upon his senses shutting out all else endlinehere startlinehere again he wept and called and blindly fought the heavy miles away endlinehere startlinehere my own wife endlinehere startlinehere he lurched with failing pulse endlinehere startlinehere along the dyke the keen air blew in gusts and grasses bent and wailed before the wind endlinehere startlinehere the zuider zee which croons all night and thrusts long stealthy fingers up some way to find and crumble down the stones moaned baffled endlinehere startlinehere here the wide armed windmills looked like gallows trees endlinehere startlinehere no lights were burning in the distant thorps endlinehere startlinehere max laid aside his coat endlinehere startlinehere his mind half clear babbled christine endlinehere startlinehere a shot split through the breeze endlinehere startlinehere the cold stars winked and glittered at his chilling corpse endlinehere startlinehere dear virgin mary far away look down from heaven while i pray endlinehere startlinehere open your golden casement high and lean way out beyond the sky endlinehere startlinehere i am so little it may be a task for you to harken me endlinehere startlinehere o lady mary i have bought a candle as the good priest taught endlinehere startlinehere i only had one penny so old goody jenkins let it go endlinehere startlinehere it is a little bent you see endlinehere startlinehere but oh be merciful to me endlinehere startlinehere i have not anything to give yet i so long for him to live endlinehere startlinehere a year ago he sailed away and not a word unto today endlinehere startlinehere ive strained my eyes from the sea wall but never does he come at all endlinehere startlinehere other ships have entered port their voyages finished long or short and other sailors have received their welcomes while i sat and grieved endlinehere startlinehere my heart is bursting for his hail o virgin let me spy his sail endlinehere startlinehere _hull down on the edge of a sun soaked sea sparkle the bellying sails for me endlinehere startlinehere taut to the push of a rousing wind shaking the sea till it foams behind the tightened rigging is shrill with the song we are back again who were gone so long endlinehere startlinehere _ one afternoon i bumped my head endlinehere startlinehere i sat on a post and wished i were dead like father and mother for no one cared whither i went or how i fared endlinehere startlinehere a mans voice said my little lad heres a bit of a toy to make you glad endlinehere startlinehere he held out his hand and gave to me the most marvellous top which could ever be endlinehere startlinehere it had ivory eyes and jet black rings and a red stone carved into little wings all joined by a twisted golden line and set in the brown wood even and fine endlinehere startlinehere it couldnt mean quite the same to you endlinehere startlinehere every day i met him there where the fisher nets dry in the sunny air endlinehere startlinehere he told me stories of courts and kings of storms at sea of lots of things endlinehere startlinehere the top he said was a sort of sign that something in the big world was mine endlinehere startlinehere _blue and white on a sun shot ocean endlinehere startlinehere against the horizon a glint in motion endlinehere startlinehere full in the grasp of a shoving wind trailing her bubbles of foam behind singing and shouting to port she races a flying harp with her sheets and braces endlinehere startlinehere _ o queen of heaven give me heed i am in very utmost need endlinehere startlinehere he loved me he was all i had and when he came it made the sad thoughts disappear endlinehere startlinehere this very day send his ship home to me i pray endlinehere startlinehere ill be a priest if you want it so ill work till i have enough to go and study latin to say the prayers on the rosary our old priest wears endlinehere startlinehere i wished to be a sailor too but i will give myself to you endlinehere startlinehere ill never even spin my top but put it away in a box endlinehere startlinehere ill stop whistling the sailor songs he taught endlinehere startlinehere ill save my pennies till i have bought a silver heart in the market square ive seen some beautiful white ones there endlinehere startlinehere ill give up all i want to do and do whatever you tell me to endlinehere startlinehere heavenly lady take away all the games i like to play take my life to fill the score only bring him back once more endlinehere startlinehere _the poplars shiver and turn their leaves and the wind through the belfry moans and grieves endlinehere startlinehere the gray dust whirls in the market square and the silver hearts are covered with care by thick tarpaulins endlinehere startlinehere once again the bay is black under heavy rain endlinehere startlinehere _ the queen of heaven has shut her door endlinehere startlinehere a little boy weeps and prays no more endlinehere startlinehere but why did i kill him endlinehere startlinehere in the small gilded room near the stair endlinehere startlinehere my ears rack and throb with his cry and his eyes goggle under his hair as my fingers sink into the fair white skin of his throat endlinehere startlinehere i killed him endlinehere startlinehere i shook him until his red tongue hung flapping out through the black queer swollen lines of his lips endlinehere startlinehere and i clung with my nails drawing blood while i flung the loose heavy body in fear endlinehere startlinehere fear lest he should still not be dead endlinehere startlinehere i was drunk with the lust of his life endlinehere startlinehere the blood drops oozed slow from his head and dabbled a chair endlinehere startlinehere and our strife lasted one reeling second his knife lay and winked in the lights overhead endlinehere startlinehere and the waltz from the ballroom i heard when i called him a low sneaking cur endlinehere startlinehere and the wail of the violins stirred my brute anger with visions of her endlinehere startlinehere as i throttled his windpipe the purr of his breath with the waltz became blurred endlinehere startlinehere i have ridden ten miles through the dark with that music an infernal din pounding rhythmic inside me endlinehere startlinehere and my fingers sink in to his flesh when the violins thin and straining with passion grow stark endlinehere startlinehere oh the horror of sound endlinehere startlinehere while she danced i was crushing his throat endlinehere startlinehere he had tasted the joy of her wound round her body and i heard him gloat on the favour endlinehere startlinehere that instant i smote endlinehere startlinehere how the dancers swirl round endlinehere startlinehere he is here in the room in my arm his limp body hangs on the spin of the waltz we are dancing a swarm of blood drops is hemming us in endlinehere startlinehere and his sin is red like his tongue lolling warm endlinehere startlinehere and the drums are his knell endlinehere startlinehere he is heavy his feet beat the floor as i drag him about in the swell of the waltz endlinehere startlinehere with a menacing roar the trumpets crash in through the door endlinehere startlinehere clangs his funeral bell endlinehere startlinehere in the chaos of space rolls the earth to the hideous glee of death endlinehere startlinehere and so cramped is this place i stifle and pant endlinehere startlinehere tis he throttles me endlinehere startlinehere he has covered my mouth with his face endlinehere startlinehere and his blood has dripped into my heart endlinehere startlinehere and my heart beats and labours endlinehere startlinehere his dead limbs have coiled every part of my body in tentacles endlinehere startlinehere through my ears the waltz jangles endlinehere startlinehere like glue his dead body holds me athwart endlinehere startlinehere i am drowning in slime endlinehere startlinehere and his corpse like a clod beats me into a jelly endlinehere startlinehere the chime one endlinehere startlinehere and his dead legs keep time endlinehere startlinehere the fountain bent and straightened itself in the night wind blowing like a flower endlinehere startlinehere it gleamed and glittered a tall white lily under the eye of the golden moon endlinehere startlinehere from a stone seat beneath a blossoming lime the man watched it endlinehere startlinehere and the spray pattered on the dim grass at his feet endlinehere startlinehere the fountain tossed its water up and up like silver marbles endlinehere startlinehere is that an arm he sees endlinehere startlinehere and for one moment does he catch the moving curve of a thigh endlinehere startlinehere the fountain gurgled and splashed and the mans face was wet endlinehere startlinehere is it singing that he hears endlinehere startlinehere a song of playing at ball endlinehere startlinehere the moonlight shines on the straight column of water and through it he sees a woman tossing the water balls endlinehere startlinehere her breasts point outwards and the nipples are like buds of peonies endlinehere startlinehere her flanks ripple as she plays and the water is not more undulating than the lines of her body endlinehere startlinehere am i not more worth than your day ladies covered with awkward stuffs unreal unbeautiful endlinehere startlinehere what do you fear in taking me endlinehere startlinehere is not the night for poets endlinehere startlinehere i am your dream recurrent as water gemmed with the moon endlinehere startlinehere she steps to the edge of the pool and the water runs rustling down her sides endlinehere startlinehere she stretches out her arms and the fountain streams behind her like an opened veil endlinehere startlinehere in the morning the gardeners came to their work endlinehere startlinehere there is something in the fountain said one endlinehere startlinehere they shuddered as they laid their dead master on the grass endlinehere startlinehere i will close his eyes said the head gardener it is uncanny to see a dead man staring at the sun endlinehere startlinehere i the inkstand is full of ink and the paper lies white and unspotted in the round of light thrown by a candle endlinehere startlinehere puffs of darkness sweep into the corners and keep rolling through the room behind his chair endlinehere startlinehere the air is silver and pearl for the night is liquid with moonlight endlinehere startlinehere see how the roof glitters like ice endlinehere startlinehere over there a slice of yellow cuts into the silver blue and beside it stand two geraniums purple because the light is silver blue to night endlinehere startlinehere she is coming the young woman with the bright hair endlinehere startlinehere she swings a basket as she walks which she places on the sill between the geranium stalks endlinehere startlinehere he laughs and crumples his paper as he leans forward to look endlinehere startlinehere the basket filled with moonlight what a title for a book endlinehere startlinehere the bellying clouds swing over the housetops endlinehere startlinehere he has forgotten the woman in the room with the geraniums endlinehere startlinehere he is beating his brain and in his eardrums hammers his heavy pulse endlinehere startlinehere she sits on the window sill with the basket in her lap endlinehere startlinehere she cracks a nut endlinehere startlinehere the shells ricochet upon the roof and get into the gutters and bounce over the edge and disappear endlinehere startlinehere it is very queer thinks peter the basket was empty im sure endlinehere startlinehere how could nuts appear from the atmosphere endlinehere startlinehere the geraniums are very gay in their crimson array endlinehere startlinehere the bellying clouds swing over the housetops and over the roofs goes peter to pay his mornings work with a holiday endlinehere startlinehere annette it is i endlinehere startlinehere peter jumps through the window endlinehere startlinehere dear are you alone endlinehere startlinehere look peter the dome of the tabernacle is done endlinehere startlinehere this gold thread is so very high i am glad it is morning a starry sky would have seen me bankrupt endlinehere startlinehere sit down now tell me is your story going well endlinehere startlinehere the golden dome glittered in the orange of the setting sun endlinehere startlinehere on the walls at intervals hung altar cloths and chasubles and copes and stoles and coffin palls endlinehere startlinehere all stiff with rich embroidery and stitched with so much artistry they seemed like spun and woven gems or flower buds new opened on their stems endlinehere startlinehere annette looked at the geraniums very red against the blue sky endlinehere startlinehere no matter how i try i cannot find any thread of such a red endlinehere startlinehere my bleeding hearts drip stuff muddy in comparison endlinehere startlinehere see my little pecking dove endlinehere startlinehere im in love with my own temple endlinehere startlinehere only that halos wrong endlinehere startlinehere the colours too strong or not strong enough endlinehere startlinehere my eyes are tired endlinehere startlinehere oh peter dont be so rough it is valuable endlinehere startlinehere i wont do any more endlinehere startlinehere you tyrannise dear thats enough endlinehere startlinehere now sit down and amuse me while i rest endlinehere startlinehere the shadows of the geraniums creep over the floor and begin to climb the opposite wall endlinehere startlinehere peter watches her fluid with fatigue floating and drifting and undulant in the orange glow endlinehere startlinehere his senses flow towards her where she lies supine and dreaming endlinehere startlinehere seeming drowned in a golden halo endlinehere startlinehere the pungent smell of the geraniums is hard to bear endlinehere startlinehere he pushes against her knees and brushes his lips across her languid hands endlinehere startlinehere his lips are hot and speechless endlinehere startlinehere he woos her quivering and the room is filled with shadows for the sun has set endlinehere startlinehere but she only understands the ways of a needle through delicate stuffs and the shock of one colour on another endlinehere startlinehere she does not see that this is the same and querulously murmurs his name endlinehere startlinehere peter i dont want it endlinehere startlinehere and he the undesired burns and is consumed endlinehere startlinehere there is a crescent moon on the rim of the sky endlinehere startlinehere iii go home now peter endlinehere startlinehere to night is full moon endlinehere startlinehere i must be alone endlinehere startlinehere how soon the moon is full again endlinehere startlinehere annette let me stay endlinehere startlinehere indeed dear love i shall not go away endlinehere startlinehere my god but you keep me starved endlinehere startlinehere you write no entrance here over all the doors endlinehere startlinehere is it not strange my dear that loving yet you deny me entrance everywhere endlinehere startlinehere would marriage strike you blind or hating bonds as you do why should i be denied the rights of loving if i leave you free endlinehere startlinehere you want the whole of me you pick my brains to rest you but you give me not one heart beat endlinehere startlinehere oh forgive me sweet endlinehere startlinehere i suffer in my loving and you know it endlinehere startlinehere i cannot feed my life on being a poet endlinehere startlinehere as you please poor peter but it will hurt me if you do endlinehere startlinehere it will crush your heart and squeeze the love out endlinehere startlinehere he answered gruffly i know what im about endlinehere startlinehere only remember one thing from to night endlinehere startlinehere my work is taxing and i must have sight endlinehere startlinehere the clear moon looks in between the geraniums endlinehere startlinehere on the wall the shadow of the man is divided from the shadow of the woman by a silver thread endlinehere startlinehere they are eyes hundreds of eyes round like marbles endlinehere startlinehere unwinking for there are no lids endlinehere startlinehere blue black gray and hazel and the irises are cased in the whites and they glitter and spark under the moon endlinehere startlinehere the basket is heaped with human eyes endlinehere startlinehere she cracks off the whites and throws them away endlinehere startlinehere they ricochet upon the roof and get into the gutters and bounce over the edge and disappear endlinehere startlinehere but she is here quietly sitting on the window sill eating human eyes endlinehere startlinehere iv how hot the sheets are endlinehere startlinehere his skin is tormented with pricks and over him sticks and never moves an eye endlinehere startlinehere it lights the sky with blood and drips blood endlinehere startlinehere and the drops sizzle on his bare skin and he smells them burning in and branding his body with the name annette endlinehere startlinehere the blood red sky is outside his window now endlinehere startlinehere and his heart wrenches and pounds annette endlinehere startlinehere the lead of the roof is scorching he ricochets gets to the edge bounces over and disappears endlinehere startlinehere the bellying clouds are red as they swing over the housetops endlinehere startlinehere v the air is of silver and pearl for the night is liquid with moonlight endlinehere startlinehere how the ruin glistens like a palace of ice endlinehere startlinehere only two black holes swallow the brilliance of the moon endlinehere startlinehere deflowered windows sockets without sight endlinehere startlinehere a man stands before the house endlinehere startlinehere he sees the silver blue moonlight and set in it over his head staring and flickering eyes of geranium red endlinehere startlinehere i over the yawning chimney hangs the fog endlinehere startlinehere drip hiss drip hiss fall the raindrops on the oaken log which burns and steams and smokes the ceiling beams endlinehere startlinehere drip hiss the rain never stops endlinehere startlinehere the wide state bed shivers beneath its velvet coverlet endlinehere startlinehere above dim in the smoke a tarnished coronet gleams dully endlinehere startlinehere overhead hammers and chinks the rain endlinehere startlinehere fearfully wails the wind down distant corridors and there comes the swish and sigh of rushes lifted off the floors endlinehere startlinehere the arras blows sidewise out from the wall and then falls back again endlinehere startlinehere it is my ladys key confided with much nice cunning whisperingly endlinehere startlinehere he enters on a sob of wind which gutters the candles almost to swaling endlinehere startlinehere the fire flutters and drops endlinehere startlinehere he shuts the door endlinehere startlinehere the rushes fall again to stillness along the floor endlinehere startlinehere outside the wind goes wailing endlinehere startlinehere the velvet coverlet of the wide bed is smooth and cold endlinehere startlinehere above in the firelight winks the coronet of tarnished gold endlinehere startlinehere the knight shivers in his coat of fur and holds out his hands to the withering flame endlinehere startlinehere she is always the same a sweet coquette endlinehere startlinehere he will wait for her endlinehere startlinehere how the log hisses and drips endlinehere startlinehere how warm and satisfying will be her lips endlinehere startlinehere is it guilt to free a lady from her palsied lord absent and fighting terribly abhorred endlinehere startlinehere he stirs a booted heel and kicks a rolling coal endlinehere startlinehere his spur clinks on the hearth endlinehere startlinehere overhead the rain hammers and chinks endlinehere startlinehere she is so pure and whole endlinehere startlinehere only because he has her soul will she resign herself to him for where the soul has gone the body must be given as a sign endlinehere startlinehere he takes her by the divine right of the only lover endlinehere startlinehere he has sworn to fight her lord and wed her after endlinehere startlinehere should he be overborne she will die adoring him forlorn shriven by her great love endlinehere startlinehere above the coronet winks in the darkness endlinehere startlinehere drip hiss fall the raindrops endlinehere startlinehere the arras blows out from the wall and a door bangs in a far off hall endlinehere startlinehere the candles swale endlinehere startlinehere in the gale the moat below plunges and spatters endlinehere startlinehere will the lady lose courage and not come endlinehere startlinehere the rain claps on a loosened rafter endlinehere startlinehere is that laughter endlinehere startlinehere the room is filled with lisps and whispers endlinehere startlinehere one candle drowns and the other gutters endlinehere startlinehere is that the rain which pads and patters is it the wind through the winding entries which chatters endlinehere startlinehere the state bed is very cold and he is alone endlinehere startlinehere how far from the wall the arras is blown endlinehere startlinehere it is no storm which makes these little chuckling sounds endlinehere startlinehere by the great wounds of holy jesus it is his dear lady kissing and clasping someone endlinehere startlinehere through the sobbing storm he hears her love take form and flutter out in words endlinehere startlinehere they prick into his ears and stun his desire which lies within him hard and dead like frozen fire endlinehere startlinehere and the little noise never stops endlinehere startlinehere he tears down the arras from before an inner chambers bolted door endlinehere startlinehere ii the state bed shivers in the watery dawn endlinehere startlinehere for the storm never stops endlinehere startlinehere on the velvet coverlet lie two bodies stripped and fair in the cold grey air endlinehere startlinehere drip hiss fall the blood drops for the bleeding never stops endlinehere startlinehere at each side of the bed on the floor is a head endlinehere startlinehere a mans on this side a womans on that and the red blood oozes along the rush mat endlinehere startlinehere a wisp of paper is twisted carefully into the strands of the dead mans hair endlinehere startlinehere it says my lord your wifes paramour has paid with his life for the high favour endlinehere startlinehere through the ladys silver fillet is wound another paper endlinehere startlinehere it reads most noble lord your wifes misdeeds are as a double stranded necklace of beads endlinehere startlinehere but i have engaged that on your return she shall welcome you here endlinehere startlinehere she will not spurn your love as before you have still the best part of her endlinehere startlinehere her blood was red her body white they will both be here for your delight endlinehere startlinehere the soul inside was a lump of dirt i have rid you of that with a spurt of my sword point endlinehere startlinehere good luck to your pleasure endlinehere startlinehere she will be quite complaisant my friend i wager endlinehere startlinehere the end was a splashed flourish of ink endlinehere startlinehere in the passage is heard the clink of armour the tread of a heavy man endlinehere startlinehere the door bursts open and standing there his thin hair wavering in the glare of steely daylight is my lord of clair endlinehere startlinehere over the yawning chimney hangs the fog endlinehere startlinehere overhead hammers and chinks the rain which never stops endlinehere startlinehere the velvet coverlet is sodden and wet yet the roof beams are tight endlinehere startlinehere overhead the coronet gleams with its blackened gold winking and blinking endlinehere startlinehere among the rushes three corpses are growing cold endlinehere startlinehere iii in the castle church you may see them stand two sumptuous tombs on either hand of the choir my lords and my ladys grand in sculptured filigrees endlinehere startlinehere and where the transepts of the church expand a crusader come from the holy land lies with crossed legs and embroidered band endlinehere startlinehere the pages name became a brand for shame endlinehere startlinehere he was buried in crawling sand after having been burnt by royal command endlinehere startlinehere the bell in the convent tower swung endlinehere startlinehere high overhead the great sun hung a navel for the curving sky endlinehere startlinehere the air was a blue clarity endlinehere startlinehere swallows flew and a cock crew endlinehere startlinehere the iron clanging sank through the light air rustled over with blowing branches endlinehere startlinehere a flare of spotted green and a snake had gone into the bed where the snowdrops shone in green new started their white bells parted endlinehere startlinehere two by two in a long brown line the nuns were walking to breathe the fine bright april air endlinehere startlinehere they must go in soon and work at their tasks all the afternoon endlinehere startlinehere but this time is theirs endlinehere startlinehere they walk in pairs endlinehere startlinehere first comes the abbess preoccupied and slow as a woman often tried with her temper in bond endlinehere startlinehere then the oldest nun endlinehere startlinehere then younger and younger until the last one has a laugh on her lips and fairly skips endlinehere startlinehere they wind about the gravel walks and all the long line buzzes and talks endlinehere startlinehere they step in time to the ringing bell with scarcely a shadow endlinehere startlinehere the sun is well in the core of a sky domed silverly endlinehere startlinehere sister marguerite said the pears will soon bud endlinehere startlinehere sister angelique said she must get her spud and free the earth round the jasmine roots endlinehere startlinehere sister veronique said oh look at those shoots endlinehere startlinehere theres a crocus up with a purple cup endlinehere startlinehere but sister clotilde said nothing at all she looked up and down the old grey wall to see if a lizard were basking there endlinehere startlinehere she looked across the garden to where a sycamore flanked the garden door endlinehere startlinehere she was restless although her little feet danced and quite unsatisfied for it chanced her mornings work had hung in her mind and would not take form endlinehere startlinehere she could not find the beautifulness for the virgins dress endlinehere startlinehere should it be of pink or damasked blue endlinehere startlinehere or perhaps lilac with gold shotted through endlinehere startlinehere should it be banded with yellow and white roses or sparked like a frosty night endlinehere startlinehere or a crimson sheen over some sort of green endlinehere startlinehere but clotildes eyes saw nothing new in all the garden no single hue so lovely or so marvellous that its use would not seem impious endlinehere startlinehere so on she walked and the others talked endlinehere startlinehere sister elisabeth edged away from what her companion had to say for sister marthe saw the world in little she weighed every grain and recorded each tittle endlinehere startlinehere she did plain stitching and worked in the kitchen endlinehere startlinehere sister radegonde knows the apples wont last i told her so this friday past endlinehere startlinehere i must speak to her before compline endlinehere startlinehere her words were like dust motes in slanting sunshine endlinehere startlinehere the other nun sighed with her pleasure quite dried endlinehere startlinehere suddenly sister berthe cried out the snowdrops are blooming endlinehere startlinehere they turned about endlinehere startlinehere the little white cups bent over the ground and in among the light stems wound a crested snake with his eyes awake endlinehere startlinehere his crest was amber glittered with blue and opaque so the sun came shining through endlinehere startlinehere it seemed a crown with fiery points endlinehere startlinehere when he quivered all down his scaly joints from every slot the sparkles shot endlinehere startlinehere the nuns huddled tightly together fear catching their senses endlinehere startlinehere but clotilde must peer more closely at the beautiful snake she seemed entranced and eased endlinehere startlinehere could she make colours so rare the dress were there endlinehere startlinehere the abbess shook off her lethargy endlinehere startlinehere sisters we will walk on said she endlinehere startlinehere sidling away from the snowdrop bed the line curved forwards the abbess ahead endlinehere startlinehere only clotilde was the last to yield endlinehere startlinehere when the recreation hour was done each went in to her task endlinehere startlinehere alone in the library with its great north light clotilde wrought at an exquisite wreath of flowers for her book of hours endlinehere startlinehere they framed the picture she had made half delighted and half afraid endlinehere startlinehere in a courtyard with a lozenged floor the virgin watched and through the arched door the angel came like a springing flame endlinehere startlinehere his wings were dipped in violet fire his limbs were strung to holy desire endlinehere startlinehere he lowered his head and passed under the arch and the air seemed beating a solemn march endlinehere startlinehere the virgin waited with eyes dilated endlinehere startlinehere her face was quiet and innocent and beautiful with her strange assent endlinehere startlinehere a silver thread about her head her halo was poised endlinehere startlinehere but in the stead of her gown there remained the vellum unstained endlinehere startlinehere clotilde painted the flowers patiently lingering over each tint and dye endlinehere startlinehere she could spend great pains now she had seen that curious unimagined green endlinehere startlinehere a colour so strange it had seemed to change endlinehere startlinehere she thought it had altered while she gazed endlinehere startlinehere at first it had been simple green then glazed all over with twisting flames each spot a molten colour trembling and hot and every eye seemed to liquefy endlinehere startlinehere she had made a plan and her spirits danced endlinehere startlinehere after all she had only glanced at that wonderful snake and she must know just what hues made the creature throw those splashes and sprays of prismed rays endlinehere startlinehere when evening prayers were sung and said the nuns lit their tapers and went to bed endlinehere startlinehere and soon in the convent there was no light for the moon did not rise until late that night only the shine of the lamp at the shrine endlinehere startlinehere clotilde lay still in her trembling sheets endlinehere startlinehere her heart shook her body with its beats endlinehere startlinehere she could not see till the moon should rise so she whispered prayers and kept her eyes on the window square till light should be there endlinehere startlinehere the faintest shadow of a branch fell on the floor endlinehere startlinehere clotilde grown staunch with solemn purpose softly rose and fluttered down between the rows of sleeping nuns endlinehere startlinehere she almost runs endlinehere startlinehere she must go out through the little side door lest the nuns who were always praying before the virgins altar should hear her pass endlinehere startlinehere she pushed the bolts and over the grass the red moons brim mounted its rim endlinehere startlinehere her shadow crept up the convent wall as she swiftly left it over all the garden lay the level glow of a moon coming up very big and slow endlinehere startlinehere the gravel glistened endlinehere startlinehere she stopped and listened endlinehere startlinehere it was still and the moonlight was getting clearer endlinehere startlinehere she laughed a little but she felt queerer than ever before endlinehere startlinehere the snowdrop bed was reached and she bent down her head endlinehere startlinehere on the striped ground the snake was wound endlinehere startlinehere for a moment clotilde paused in alarm then she rolled up her sleeve and stretched out her arm endlinehere startlinehere she thought she heard steps she must be quick endlinehere startlinehere she darted her hand out and seized the thick wriggling slime only just in time endlinehere startlinehere the old gardener came muttering down the path and his shadow fell like a broad black swath and covered clotilde and the angry snake endlinehere startlinehere he bit her but what difference did that make endlinehere startlinehere the virgin should dress in his loveliness endlinehere startlinehere the gardener was covering his new set plants for the night was chilly and nothing daunts your lover of growing things endlinehere startlinehere he spied something to do and turned aside and the moonlight streamed on clotilde and gleamed endlinehere startlinehere his business finished the gardener rose endlinehere startlinehere he shook and swore for the moonlight shows a girl with a fire tongued serpent she grasping him laughing while quietly her eyes are weeping endlinehere startlinehere is he sleeping endlinehere startlinehere he thinks it is some holy vision brushes that aside and with decision jumps and hits the snake with his stick crushes his spine and then with quick urgent command takes her hand endlinehere startlinehere the gardener sucks the poison and spits cursing and praying as befits a poor old man half out of his wits endlinehere startlinehere whatever possessed you sister its hatched of a devil and very evil endlinehere startlinehere its one of them horrid basilisks you read about endlinehere startlinehere they say a man risks his life to touch it but i guess ive sucked it out by now endlinehere startlinehere lucky i chucked it away from you endlinehere startlinehere he is dead now but his colours wont fade at once and by noon i shall have made the virgins robe endlinehere startlinehere oh francois see how kindly the moon shines down on me endlinehere startlinehere i cant die yet for the task was set endlinehere startlinehere you wont die now for ive sucked it away grumbled old francois so have your play endlinehere startlinehere if the virgin is set on snakes colours so strong francois dont say things like that it is wrong endlinehere startlinehere so clotilde vented her creed endlinehere startlinehere he cant do no more harm sister said he endlinehere startlinehere paint as much as you like endlinehere startlinehere and gingerly he picked up the snake with his stick endlinehere startlinehere clotilde thanked him and begged that he would shield her secret though itching to talk in the kitchen endlinehere startlinehere at dawns first saffron spired warning clotilde was up endlinehere startlinehere and all that morning except when she went to the chapel to pray she painted and when the april day was hot with sun clotilde had done endlinehere startlinehere she drooped though her heart beat loud at the beauty before her and her spirit bowed to the virgin her finely touched thought had made endlinehere startlinehere a lady in excellence arrayed and wonder souled endlinehere startlinehere from long fasting clotilde felt weary and faint but her eyes were starred like those of a saint enmeshed in heavens beatitude endlinehere startlinehere a sudden clamour hurled its rude force to break her vision awake endlinehere startlinehere the door nearly leapt from its hinges pushed by the multitude of nuns endlinehere startlinehere they hushed when they saw clotilde in perfect quiet smiling a little perplexed at the riot endlinehere startlinehere and all the hive buzzed shes alive endlinehere startlinehere he had found the strain of silence too great and preferred the pain of a conscience outraged endlinehere startlinehere the news had spread and all were convinced clotilde must be dead endlinehere startlinehere for francois to spite them had not seen fit to right them endlinehere startlinehere how could we have guessed our convent so blessed endlinehere startlinehere to have you die endlinehere startlinehere and i who am a hollow living shell the grave is empty of me endlinehere startlinehere holy mary i crave to be taken dear mother instead of this other endlinehere startlinehere she dropped on her knees and silently prayed with anguished hands and tears delayed to a painful slowness endlinehere startlinehere the minutes drew to fractions endlinehere startlinehere then the west wind blew the sound of a bell on a gusty swell endlinehere startlinehere it came skipping over the slates of the roof and the bright bell notes seemed a reproof to grief in the eye of so fair a day endlinehere startlinehere the abbess comforted ceased to pray endlinehere startlinehere and the sun lit the flowers in clotildes book of hours endlinehere startlinehere it glistened the green of the virgins dress and made the red spots in a flushed excess pulse and start and the violet wings of the angel were colour which shines and sings endlinehere startlinehere the book seemed a choir of rainbow fire endlinehere startlinehere the abbess crossed herself and each nun did the same then one by one they filed to the chapel that incensed prayers might plead for the life of this sister of theirs endlinehere startlinehere clotilde the inspired endlinehere startlinehere she only felt tired endlinehere startlinehere the old chronicles say she did not die until heavy with years endlinehere startlinehere and that is why there hangs in the convent church a basket of osiered silver a holy casket and treasured therein a dried snake skin endlinehere startlinehere panels of claret and blue which shine under the moon like lees of wine endlinehere startlinehere a coronet done in a golden scroll and wheels which blunder and creak as they roll through the muddy ruts of a moorland track endlinehere startlinehere they darent look back endlinehere startlinehere they are whipping and cursing the horses endlinehere startlinehere what brutes men are when they think theyre scored endlinehere startlinehere they are scared half out of their wits poor souls endlinehere startlinehere for my lord has a casket full of rolls of minted sovereigns and silver bars endlinehere startlinehere i laugh to think how hell show his scars in london to morrow endlinehere startlinehere he whines with rage in his varnished cage endlinehere startlinehere my lady has shoved her rings over her toes endlinehere startlinehere tis an ancient trick every night rider knows endlinehere startlinehere but i shall relieve her of them yet when i see she limps in the minuet i must beg to celebrate this night and the green moonlight endlinehere startlinehere theres nothing to hurry about the plain is hours long and the muds a strain endlinehere startlinehere my geldings uncommonly strong in the loins in half an hour ill bag the coins endlinehere startlinehere tis a clear sweet night on the turn of spring endlinehere startlinehere the chase is the thing endlinehere startlinehere how the coach flashes and wobbles the moon dripping down so quietly on it endlinehere startlinehere a tune is beating out of the curses and screams and the cracking all through the painted seams endlinehere startlinehere steady old horse well keep it in sight endlinehere startlinehere tis a rare fine night endlinehere startlinehere theres a clump of trees on the dip of the down and the sky shimmers where it hangs over the town endlinehere startlinehere it seems a shame to break the air in two with this pistol but ive my share of drudgery like other men endlinehere startlinehere hold up you beast now what the devil endlinehere startlinehere confound this moor for a pockholed evil rotten marsh endlinehere startlinehere my right legs snapped endlinehere startlinehere tis a mercy hes rolled but im nicely capped endlinehere startlinehere a broken legged man and a broken legged horse endlinehere startlinehere theyll get me of course endlinehere startlinehere the cursed coach will reach the town and theyll all come out every loafer grown a lion to handcuff a man thats down endlinehere startlinehere oh the coachmans bulleted hat endlinehere startlinehere ill give it a head to fit it pat endlinehere startlinehere _they handcuffed the body just for style and they hung him in chains for the volatile wind to scour him flesh from bones endlinehere startlinehere way out on the moor you can hear the groans his gibbet makes when it blows a gale endlinehere startlinehere tis a common tale endlinehere startlinehere _ paul jannes was working very late for this watch must be done by eight to morrow or the cardinal would certainly be vexed endlinehere startlinehere so they picked his pocket and he paid in jewels for his slobbering kisses endlinehere startlinehere this watch was made to buy him blisses from an austrian countess on her way home and she meant to start next day endlinehere startlinehere paul worked by the pointed tulip flame of a tallow candle and became so absorbed that his old clock made him wince striking the hour a moment since endlinehere startlinehere its echo only half apprehended lingered about the room endlinehere startlinehere he ended screwing the little rubies in setting the wheels to lock and spin curling the infinitesimal springs fixing the filigree hands endlinehere startlinehere chippings of precious stones lay strewn about endlinehere startlinehere the table before him was a rout of splashes and sparks of coloured light endlinehere startlinehere there was yellow gold in sheets and quite a heap of emeralds and steel endlinehere startlinehere here was a gem there was a wheel endlinehere startlinehere and glasses lay like limpid lakes shining and still and there were flakes of silver and shavings of pearl and little wires all awhirl with the light of the candle endlinehere startlinehere he took the watch and wound its hands about to match the time then glanced up to take the hour from the hanging clock endlinehere startlinehere good merciful power endlinehere startlinehere how came that shadow on the wall no woman was in the room endlinehere startlinehere his tall chiffonier stood gaunt behind his chair endlinehere startlinehere his old cloak rabbit lined hung from a peg endlinehere startlinehere the door was closed endlinehere startlinehere just for a moment he must have dozed endlinehere startlinehere he looked again and saw it plain endlinehere startlinehere the silhouette made a blue black stain on the opposite wall and it never wavered even when the candle quavered under his panting breath endlinehere startlinehere what made that beautiful dreadful thing that shade of something so lovely so exquisite cast from a substance which the sight had not been tutored to perceive endlinehere startlinehere paul brushed his eyes across his sleeve endlinehere startlinehere clear cut the shadow on the wall gleamed black and never moved at all endlinehere startlinehere pauls watches were like amulets wrought into patterns and rosettes the cases were all set with stones and wreathing lines and shining zones endlinehere startlinehere he knew the beauty in a curve and the shadow tortured every nerve with its perfect rhythm of outline cutting the whitewashed wall endlinehere startlinehere so fine was the neck he knew he could have spanned it about with the fingers of one hand endlinehere startlinehere the lady was edged with the stamp of race endlinehere startlinehere a singular vision in such a place endlinehere startlinehere he moved the candle to the tall chiffonier the shadow stayed on the wall endlinehere startlinehere he threw his cloak upon a chair and still the ladys face was there endlinehere startlinehere from every corner of the room he saw in the patch of light the gloom that was the lady endlinehere startlinehere her violet bloom was almost brighter than that which came from his candles tulip flame endlinehere startlinehere he set the filigree hands he laid the watch in the case which he had made he put on his rabbit cloak and snuffed his candle out endlinehere startlinehere the room seemed stuffed with darkness endlinehere startlinehere softly he crossed the floor and let himself out through the door endlinehere startlinehere the sun was flashing from every pin and wheel when paul let himself in endlinehere startlinehere the whitewashed walls were hot with light endlinehere startlinehere the room was the core of a chrysolite burning and shimmering with fiery might endlinehere startlinehere the sun was so bright that no shadow could fall from the furniture upon the wall endlinehere startlinehere paul sighed as he looked at the empty space where a glare usurped the ladys place endlinehere startlinehere he settled himself to his work but his mind wandered and he would wake to find his hand suspended his eyes grown dim and nothing advanced beyond the rim of his dreaming endlinehere startlinehere the cardinal sent to pay for his watch which had purchased so fine a day endlinehere startlinehere but paul could hardly touch the gold it seemed the price of his shadow sold endlinehere startlinehere with the first twilight he struck a match and watched the little blue stars hatch into an egg of perfect flame endlinehere startlinehere he lit his candle and almost in shame at his eagerness lifted his eyes endlinehere startlinehere the shadow was there and its precise outline etched the cold white wall endlinehere startlinehere the young man swore by god endlinehere startlinehere you paul theres something the matter with your brain endlinehere startlinehere go home now and sleep off the strain endlinehere startlinehere the next day was a storm the rain whispered and scratched at the window pane endlinehere startlinehere a grey and shadowless morning filled the little shop endlinehere startlinehere the watches chilled were dead and sparkless as burnt out coals endlinehere startlinehere the gems lay on the table like shoals of stranded shells their colours faded mere heaps of stone dull and degraded endlinehere startlinehere pauls head was heavy his hands obeyed no orders for his fancy strayed endlinehere startlinehere his work became a simple round of watches repaired and watches wound endlinehere startlinehere the slanting ribbons of the rain broke themselves on the window pane but paul saw the silver lines in vain endlinehere startlinehere in the morning he selected all his perfect jacinths endlinehere startlinehere when at dusk the shadow grew upon the wall pauls work was through endlinehere startlinehere holding the watch he spoke to her lady beautiful shadow stir into one brief sign of being endlinehere startlinehere turn your eyes this way and seeing this watch made from those sweet curves where your hair from your forehead swerves accept the gift which i have wrought with your fairness in my thought endlinehere startlinehere grant me this and i shall be honoured overwhelmingly endlinehere startlinehere the shadow rested black and still and the wind sighed over the window sill endlinehere startlinehere topazes ran in a foamy stream over the cover the hands were studded with garnets and seemed red roses budded endlinehere startlinehere the face was of crystal and engraved upon it the figures flashed and waved with zircons and beryls and amethysts endlinehere startlinehere it took a week to make and his trysts at night with the shadow were his alone endlinehere startlinehere paul swore not to speak till his task was done endlinehere startlinehere the night that the jewel was worthy to give endlinehere startlinehere paul watched the long hours of daylight live to the faintest streak then lit his light and sharp against the walls pure white the outline of the shadow started into form endlinehere startlinehere his burning hearted words so long imprisoned swelled to tumbling speech endlinehere startlinehere like one compelled he told the lady all his love and holding out the watch above his head he knelt imploring some littlest sign endlinehere startlinehere the shadow was dumb endlinehere startlinehere weeks passed paul worked in fevered haste and everything he made he placed before his lady endlinehere startlinehere the shadow kept its perfect passiveness endlinehere startlinehere he wooed her with the work of his hands he waited for those dear commands she never gave endlinehere startlinehere no word no motion eased the ache of his devotion endlinehere startlinehere his days passed in a strain of toil his nights burnt up in a seething coil endlinehere startlinehere seasons shot by uncognisant he worked endlinehere startlinehere the shadow came to haunt even his days endlinehere startlinehere sometimes quite plain he saw on the wall the blackberry stain of his ladys picture endlinehere startlinehere no sun was bright enough to dazzle that from his sight endlinehere startlinehere then he would curse himself and her endlinehere startlinehere and more the beauty he could not make and give her for her comforts sake endlinehere startlinehere he would beat his weary empty hands upon the table would hold up strands of silver and gold and ask her why she scorned the best which he could buy endlinehere startlinehere he would pray as to some high niched saint that she would cure him of the taint of failure endlinehere startlinehere he would clutch the wall with his bleeding fingers if she should fall he could catch and hold her and make her live endlinehere startlinehere with sobs he would ask her to forgive all he had done endlinehere startlinehere and broken spent he would call himself impertinent presumptuous a tradesman a nothing driven to madness by the sight of heaven endlinehere startlinehere there were days when he wooed as a lover sighed in tenderness spoke to his bride urged her to patience said his skill should break the spell endlinehere startlinehere a mans sworn will could compass life even that he knew endlinehere startlinehere he would prove it true endlinehere startlinehere the edge of the shadow never blurred endlinehere startlinehere the lips of the shadow never stirred endlinehere startlinehere he would climb on chairs to reach her lips and pat her hair with his finger tips endlinehere startlinehere then deadly sick he would lie in a swoon for hours while thick phantasmagoria crowded his brain and his body shrieked in the clutch of pain endlinehere startlinehere the crisis passed he would wake and smile with a vacant joy half imbecile and quite confused not being certain why he was suffering a curtain fallen over the tortured mind beguiled his sorrow endlinehere startlinehere like a little child he would play with his watches and gems with glee calling the shadow to look and see how the spots on the ceiling danced prettily when he flashed his stones endlinehere startlinehere mother the green has slid so cunningly in between the blue and the yellow endlinehere startlinehere oh please look down endlinehere startlinehere one morning he threw the street door wide on coming in and his vigorous stride made the tools on his table rattle and jump endlinehere startlinehere in his hands he carried a new burst clump of laurel blossoms whose smooth barked stalks were pliant with sap endlinehere startlinehere as a husband talks to the wife he left an hour ago paul spoke to the shadow endlinehere startlinehere dear you know to day the calendar calls it spring and i woke this morning gathering asphodels in my dreams for you endlinehere startlinehere so i rushed out to see what flowers blew their pink and purple scented souls across the town winds dusty scrolls and made the approach to the market square a garden with smells and sunny air endlinehere startlinehere i feel so well and happy to day i think i shall take a holiday endlinehere startlinehere and to night we will have a little treat endlinehere startlinehere i am going to bring you something to eat endlinehere startlinehere he looked at the shadow anxiously endlinehere startlinehere it was quite grave and silent endlinehere startlinehere he shut the outer door and came and leant against the window frame endlinehere startlinehere dearest he said we live apart although i bear you in my heart endlinehere startlinehere we look out each from a different world endlinehere startlinehere at any moment we may be hurled asunder endlinehere startlinehere they follow their orbits we obey their laws entirely endlinehere startlinehere now you must come or i go there unless we are willing to live the flare of a lighted instant and have it gone endlinehere startlinehere a bee in the laurels began to drone endlinehere startlinehere a loosened petal fluttered prone endlinehere startlinehere man grows by eating if you eat you will be filled with our life sweet will be our planet in your mouth endlinehere startlinehere if not i must parch in deaths wide drouth until i gain to where you are and give you myself in whatever star may happen endlinehere startlinehere is it not ordered cleverly endlinehere startlinehere the shadow bloomed like a plum and clear hung in the sunlight endlinehere startlinehere it did not hear endlinehere startlinehere paul slipped away as the dusk began to dim the little shop endlinehere startlinehere he ran to the nearest inn and chose with care as much as his thin purse could bear endlinehere startlinehere returning he brushed his tools aside and laid across the table a wide napkin endlinehere startlinehere he put a glass and plate on either side in duplicate endlinehere startlinehere over the ladys excellent with loveliness the laurels bent endlinehere startlinehere in the centre the white flaked pastry stood and beside it the wine flask endlinehere startlinehere red as blood was the wine which should bring the lustihood of human life to his ladys veins endlinehere startlinehere he put meat on her plate and filled her glass and waited what should come to pass endlinehere startlinehere the shadow lay quietly on the wall endlinehere startlinehere from the street outside came a watchmans call a cloudy night endlinehere startlinehere rain beginning to fall endlinehere startlinehere and still he waited endlinehere startlinehere the clocks slow tick knocked on the silence endlinehere startlinehere he filled his own glass full of wine from his pocket he took a paper endlinehere startlinehere the twine was knotted and he searched a knife from his jumbled tools endlinehere startlinehere the cord of life snapped as he cut the little string endlinehere startlinehere he knew that he must do the thing he feared endlinehere startlinehere he shook powder into the wine and holding it up so the candles shine sparked a ruby through its heart he drank it endlinehere startlinehere dear never apart again endlinehere startlinehere you have said it was mine to do endlinehere startlinehere it is done and i am come to you endlinehere startlinehere paul jannes let the empty wine glass fall and held out his arms endlinehere startlinehere the insentient wall stared down at him with its cold white glare unstained endlinehere startlinehere the shadow was not there endlinehere startlinehere paul clutched and tore at his tightening throat endlinehere startlinehere he felt the veins in his body bloat and the hot blood run like fire and stones along the sides of his cracking bones endlinehere startlinehere but he laughed as he staggered towards the door and he laughed aloud as he sank on the floor endlinehere startlinehere the coroner took the body away and the watches were sold that saturday endlinehere startlinehere the auctioneer said one could seldom buy such watches and the prices were high endlinehere startlinehere holy mother of god merciful mary endlinehere startlinehere i am very weary endlinehere startlinehere i have come from a village miles away all day i have been coming and i ache for such far roaming endlinehere startlinehere i cannot walk as light as i used and my thoughts grow confused endlinehere startlinehere i am heavier than i was endlinehere startlinehere mary mother you know the cause endlinehere startlinehere beautiful holy lady take my shame away from me endlinehere startlinehere let this fear be only seeming let it be that i am dreaming endlinehere startlinehere for months i have hoped it was so now i am afraid i know endlinehere startlinehere lady why should this be shame just because i havent got his name endlinehere startlinehere he loved me yes lady he did and he couldnt keep it hid endlinehere startlinehere we meant to marry endlinehere startlinehere why did he die endlinehere startlinehere that day when they told me he had gone down in the avalanche and could not be found until the snow melted in spring i did nothing endlinehere startlinehere i could not cry endlinehere startlinehere why should he die endlinehere startlinehere why should he die and his child live endlinehere startlinehere his little child alive in me for my comfort endlinehere startlinehere no good god for my misery endlinehere startlinehere i cannot face the shame to be a mother and not married and the poor child to be reviled for having no father endlinehere startlinehere merciful mother holy virgin take away this sin i did endlinehere startlinehere let the baby not be endlinehere startlinehere only take the stigma off of me endlinehere startlinehere i have told no one but you holy mary endlinehere startlinehere my mother would call me whore and spit upon me the priest would have me repent and have the rest of my life spent in a convent endlinehere startlinehere i am no whore no bad woman he loved me and we were to be married endlinehere startlinehere i carried him always in my heart what did it matter if i gave him the least part of me too endlinehere startlinehere you were a virgin holy mother but you had a son you know there are times when a woman must give all endlinehere startlinehere there is some call to give and hold back nothing endlinehere startlinehere i swear i obeyed god then and this child who lives in me is the sign endlinehere startlinehere he is dead my beautiful strong man endlinehere startlinehere i shall never feel him caress me again endlinehere startlinehere this is the only baby i shall have endlinehere startlinehere oh holy virgin protect my baby endlinehere startlinehere my little helpless baby endlinehere startlinehere he will look like his father and he will be as fast a runner and as good a shot endlinehere startlinehere not that he shall be no scholar neither endlinehere startlinehere how can i think such things i am not good endlinehere startlinehere my father will have nothing to do with my boy i shall be an outcast thing endlinehere startlinehere oh mother of our lord god be merciful take away my shame endlinehere startlinehere let my body be as it was before he came endlinehere startlinehere no little baby for me to keep underneath my heart for those long months endlinehere startlinehere to live for and to get comfort from endlinehere startlinehere i cannot go home and tell my mother endlinehere startlinehere she is so hard and righteous endlinehere startlinehere she never loved my father and we were born for duty not for love endlinehere startlinehere i cannot face it endlinehere startlinehere holy mother take my baby away endlinehere startlinehere take away my little baby endlinehere startlinehere i dont want it i cant bear it endlinehere startlinehere and i shall have nothing nothing endlinehere startlinehere just be known as a good girl endlinehere startlinehere have other men want to marry me whom i could not touch after having known my man endlinehere startlinehere he is gone my man i shall never hear him or feel him again but i could not touch another endlinehere startlinehere i would rather lie under the snow with my own man in my arms endlinehere startlinehere so i shall live on and on endlinehere startlinehere just a good woman endlinehere startlinehere with nothing to warm my heart where he lay and where he left his baby for me to care for endlinehere startlinehere i shall not be quite human i think endlinehere startlinehere merely a stone dead creature endlinehere startlinehere they will respect me endlinehere startlinehere what do i care for respect endlinehere startlinehere you didnt care for peoples tongues when you were carrying our lord jesus endlinehere startlinehere god had my man give me my baby when he knew that he was going to take him away endlinehere startlinehere his lips will comfort me his hands will soothe me endlinehere startlinehere all day i will work at my lace making and all night i will keep him warm by my side and pray the blessed angels to cover him with their wings endlinehere startlinehere dear mother what is it that sings endlinehere startlinehere i hear voices singing and lovely silver trumpets through it all endlinehere startlinehere they seem just on the other side of the wall endlinehere startlinehere let me keep my baby holy mother endlinehere startlinehere he is only a poor lace makers baby with a stain upon him but give me strength to bring him up to be a man endlinehere startlinehere tang of fruitage in the air red boughs bursting everywhere shimmering of seeded grass hooded gentians all amass endlinehere startlinehere warmth of earth and cloudless wind tearing off the husky rind blowing feathered seeds to fall by the sun baked sheltering wall endlinehere startlinehere beech trees in a golden haze hardy sumachs all ablaze glowing through the silver birches endlinehere startlinehere how that pine tree shouts and lurches endlinehere startlinehere from the sunny door jamb high swings the shell of a butterfly endlinehere startlinehere scrape of insect violins through the stubble shrilly dins endlinehere startlinehere every blades a minaret where a small muezzins set loudly calling us to pray at the miracle of day endlinehere startlinehere then the purple lidded night westering comes her footsteps light guided by the radiant boon of a sickle shaped new moon endlinehere startlinehere in the brown water thick and silver sheened in the sunshine liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds a pike dozed endlinehere startlinehere lost among the shadows of stems he lay unnoticed endlinehere startlinehere suddenly he flicked his tail and a green and copper brightness ran under the water endlinehere startlinehere out from under the reeds came the olive green light and orange flashed up through the sun thickened water endlinehere startlinehere so the fish passed across the pool green and copper a darkness and a gleam and the blurred reflections of the willows on the opposite bank received it endlinehere startlinehere where is she the woman who wore it endlinehere startlinehere the scent of her lingers and drugs me endlinehere startlinehere a languor fire shotted runs through me and i crush the scarf down on my face and gulp in the warmth and the blueness and my eyes swim in cool tinted heavens endlinehere startlinehere around me are columns of marble and a diapered sun flickered pavement endlinehere startlinehere rose leaves blow and patter against it endlinehere startlinehere below the stone steps a lute tinkles endlinehere startlinehere a jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor endlinehere startlinehere a big bellied frog hops through the sunlight and plops in the gold bubbled water of a basin sunk in the black and white marble endlinehere startlinehere the west wind has lifted a scarf on the seat close beside me the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour endlinehere startlinehere she draws it more closely about her and it ripples beneath her slight stirring endlinehere startlinehere how loud clocks can tick when a room is empty and one is alone endlinehere startlinehere my daffodil crowned slim and without sandals endlinehere startlinehere as the sudden spurt of flame upon darkness so my eyeballs are startled with you supple limbed youth among the fruit trees light runner through tasselled orchards endlinehere startlinehere you are an almond flower unsheathed leaping and flickering between the budded branches endlinehere startlinehere as i would free the white almond from the green husk so would i strip your trappings off beloved endlinehere startlinehere and fingering the smooth and polished kernel i should see that in my hands glittered a gem beyond counting endlinehere startlinehere the neighbour sits in his window and plays the flute endlinehere startlinehere from my bed i can hear him and the round notes flutter and tap about the room and hit against each other blurring to unexpected chords endlinehere startlinehere it is very beautiful with the little flute notes all about me in the darkness endlinehere startlinehere in the daytime the neighbour eats bread and onions with one hand and copies music with the other endlinehere startlinehere he is fat and has a bald head so i do not look at him but run quickly past his window endlinehere startlinehere there is always the sky to look at or the water in the well endlinehere startlinehere but when night comes and he plays his flute i think of him as a young man with gold seals hanging from his watch and a blue coat with silver buttons endlinehere startlinehere you are beautiful and faded like an old opera tune played upon a harpsichord or like the sun flooded silks of an eighteenth century boudoir endlinehere startlinehere in your eyes smoulder the fallen roses of out lived minutes and the perfume of your soul is vague and suffusing with the pungence of sealed spice jars endlinehere startlinehere your half tones delight me and i grow mad with gazing at your blent colours endlinehere startlinehere my vigour is a new minted penny which i cast at your feet endlinehere startlinehere gather it up from the dust that its sparkle may amuse you endlinehere startlinehere damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone where trickle and plash the fountains marble fountains yellowed with much water endlinehere startlinehere splashing down moss tarnished steps it falls the water and the air is throbbing with it endlinehere startlinehere with its gurgling and running endlinehere startlinehere with its leaping and deep cool murmur endlinehere startlinehere and i wished for night and you endlinehere startlinehere i wanted to see you in the swimming pool white and shining in the silver flecked water endlinehere startlinehere while the moon rode over the garden high in the arch of night and the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness endlinehere startlinehere night and the water and you in your whiteness bathing endlinehere startlinehere guarded within the old red walls embrace marshalled like soldiers in gay company the tulips stand arrayed endlinehere startlinehere here infantry wheels out into the sunlight endlinehere startlinehere what bold grace sets off their tunics white with crimson lace endlinehere startlinehere here are platoons of gold frocked cavalry with scarlet sabres tossing in the eye of purple batteries every gun in place endlinehere startlinehere forward they come with flaunting colours spread with torches burning stepping out in time to some quick unheard march endlinehere startlinehere our ears are dead we cannot catch the tune endlinehere startlinehere in pantomime parades that army endlinehere startlinehere with our utmost powers we hear the wind stream through a bed of flowers endlinehere startlinehere as a monk who prays changed to there are none ever endlinehere startlinehere as a monk who prays a tale of starvation and he neither eat nor drank endlinehere startlinehere changed to and he neither ate nor drank endlinehere startlinehere the great adventure of max breuck stanza headings were originally roman numerals endlinehere startlinehere and terror wingd steps endlinehere startlinehere before the altar bowed he stands with empty hands upon it perfumed offerings burn wreathing with smoke the sacrificial urn endlinehere startlinehere his sole condition love and poverty endlinehere startlinehere shining and distant goddess hear my prayer where you swim in the high air endlinehere startlinehere with charity look down on me under this tree tending the gifts i have not brought the rare and goodly things i have not sought endlinehere startlinehere instead take from me all my life endlinehere startlinehere upon the wings of shimmering moonbeams i pack my poets dreams for you endlinehere startlinehere my wearying strife my courage my loss into the night i toss for you endlinehere startlinehere golden divinity deign to look down on me who so unworthily offers to you all life has known seeds withered unsown hopes turning quick to fears laughter which dies in tears endlinehere startlinehere the shredded remnant of a man is all the span and compass of my offering to you endlinehere startlinehere empty and silent i kneel before your pure calm majesty endlinehere startlinehere on this stone in this urn i pour my heart and watch it burn myself the sacrifice but be still unmoved divinity endlinehere startlinehere from the altar bathed in moonlight the smoke rose straight in the quiet night endlinehere startlinehere wild little bird who chose thee for a sign to put upon the cover of this book endlinehere startlinehere who heard thee singing in the distance dim the vague far greenness of the enshrouding wood when the damp freshness of the morning earth was full of pungent sweetness and thy song endlinehere startlinehere we do not know what bird thou art endlinehere startlinehere perhaps that fairy bird fabled in island tale who never sings but once and then his song is of such fearful beauty that he dies from sheer exuberance of melody endlinehere startlinehere for this they took thee little bird for this they captured thee tilting among the leaves and stamped thee for a symbol on this book endlinehere startlinehere for it contains a song surpassing thine richer more sweet more poignant endlinehere startlinehere glinting golden through the trees apples of hesperides endlinehere startlinehere through the moon pierced warp of night shoot pale shafts of yellow light swaying to the kissing breeze swings the treasure golden gleaming apples of hesperides endlinehere startlinehere far and lofty yet they glimmer apples of hesperides endlinehere startlinehere blinded by their radiant shimmer pushing forward just for these dew besprinkled bramble marred poor duped mortal travel scarred always thinking soon to seize and possess the golden glistening apples of hesperides endlinehere startlinehere orbed and glittering and pendent apples of hesperides endlinehere startlinehere not one missing still transcendent clustering like a swarm of bees endlinehere startlinehere yielding to no mans desire glowing with a saffron fire splendid unassailed the golden apples of hesperides endlinehere startlinehere april had covered the hills with flickering yellows and reds the sparkle and coolness of snow was blown from the mountain beds endlinehere startlinehere across a deep sunken stream the pink of blossoming trees and from windless appleblooms the humming of many bees endlinehere startlinehere the air was of rose and gold arabesqued with the song of birds who swinging unseen under leaves made music more eager than words endlinehere startlinehere of a sudden aslant the road a brightness to dazzle and stun a glint of the bluest blue a flash from a sapphire sun endlinehere startlinehere blue birds so blue t was a dream an impossible unconceived hue the high sky of summer dropped down some rapturous ocean to woo endlinehere startlinehere such a colour such infinite light endlinehere startlinehere the heart of a fabulous gem many faceted brilliant and rare endlinehere startlinehere centre stone of the earths diadem endlinehere startlinehere centre stone of the crown of the world sincerity graved on your youth endlinehere startlinehere and your eyes hold the blue bird flash the sapphire shaft which is truth endlinehere startlinehere life is a stream on which we strew petal by petal the flower of our heart the end lost in dream they float past our view we only watch their glad early start endlinehere startlinehere freighted with hope crimsoned with joy we scatter the leaves of our opening rose their widening scope their distant employ we never shall know endlinehere startlinehere and the stream as it flows sweeps them away each one is gone ever beyond into infinite ways endlinehere startlinehere we alone stay while years hurry on the flower fared forth though its fragrance still stays endlinehere startlinehere so through the vacancy of busy life at intervals you cross my path and bring the deep solemnity of passing years endlinehere startlinehere for you i have shed bitter tears for you i have relinquished that for which my heart cried out in selfish longing endlinehere startlinehere and to night having just left you i can say t is well endlinehere startlinehere thank god that i have known a soul so true so nobly just so worthy to be loved endlinehere startlinehere stupefy my heart to every days monotony seal up my eyes i would not look so far chasten my steps to peaceful regularity bow down my head lest i behold a star endlinehere startlinehere fill my days with work a thousand calm necessities leaving no moment to consecrate to hope girdle my thoughts within the dull circumferences of facts which form the actual in one short hours scope endlinehere startlinehere give me dreamless sleep and loose nights power over me shut my ears to sounds only tumultuous then bid fancy slumber and steal away its potency or nature wakes and strives to live again endlinehere startlinehere let each day pass well ordered in its usefulness unlit by sunshine unscarred by storm dower me with strength and curb all foolish eagerness the law exacts obedience endlinehere startlinehere high up above the open welcoming door it hangs a piece of wood with colours dim endlinehere startlinehere once long ago it was a waving tree and knew the sun and shadow through the leaves of forest trees in a thick eastern wood endlinehere startlinehere dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among its branches breaking here and there a limb but every now and then broad sunlit days lovingly lingered caught among the leaves endlinehere startlinehere an artist once with patient careful knife had fashioned it like to the untamed sea endlinehere startlinehere here waves uprear themselves their tops blown back by the gay sunny wind which whips the blue and breaks it into gleams and sparks of light endlinehere startlinehere among the flashing waves are two white birds which swoop and soar and scream for very joy at the wild sport endlinehere startlinehere now diving quickly in questing some glistening fish endlinehere startlinehere now flying up their dripping feathers shining in the sun while the wet drops like little glints of light fall pattering backward to the parent sea endlinehere startlinehere gliding along the green and foam flecked hollows or skimming some white crest about to break the spirits of the sky deigning to stoop and play with ocean in a summer mood endlinehere startlinehere when you my dear are away away how wearily goes the creeping day endlinehere startlinehere a year drags after morning and night starts another year of candle light endlinehere startlinehere o pausing sun and lingering moon endlinehere startlinehere grant me i beg of you this boon endlinehere startlinehere whirl round the earth as never sun has his diurnal journey run endlinehere startlinehere and moon slip past the ladders of air in a single flash while your streaming hair catches the stars and pulls them down to shine on some slumbering chinese town endlinehere startlinehere o kindly sun endlinehere startlinehere bring evening to crowd the footsteps of noon endlinehere startlinehere but when that long awaited day hangs ripe in the heavens your voyaging stay endlinehere startlinehere be morning o sun endlinehere startlinehere with the lark in song be afternoon for ages long endlinehere startlinehere and moon let you and your lesser lights watch over a century of nights endlinehere startlinehere here terrace sinks to terrace arbors close the ends of dreaming paths a wanton wind jostles the half ripe pears and then unkind tumbles a slumber in a pillar rose with content grown indolent endlinehere startlinehere by night my garden is oerhung with gems fixed in an onyx setting endlinehere startlinehere fireflies flicker their lanterns in my dazzled eyes endlinehere startlinehere in serried rows i guess the straight stiff stems of hollyhocks against the rocks endlinehere startlinehere who shall declare the joy of the running endlinehere startlinehere who shall tell of the pleasures of flight endlinehere startlinehere springing and spurning the tufts of wild heather sweeping wide winged through the blue dome of light endlinehere startlinehere everything mortal has moments immortal swift and god gifted immeasurably bright endlinehere startlinehere joy in the touch of the wind and the sunlight endlinehere startlinehere with the vigorous earth i am one endlinehere startlinehere to be a flower nodding in the sun bending then upspringing as the breezes run holding up a scent brimmed cup full of summers fragrance to the summer sun endlinehere startlinehere to be a butterfly still upon a flower winking with its painted wings happy in the hour endlinehere startlinehere blossoms hold mines of gold deep within the farthest heart of each chaliced flower endlinehere startlinehere to be a cloud blowing through the blue shadowing the mountains rushing loudly through valleys deep where torrents keep always their plunging thunder and their misty arch of blue endlinehere startlinehere to be a wave splintering on the sand drawing back but leaving lingeringly the land endlinehere startlinehere rainbow light flashes bright telling tales of coral caves half hid in yellow sand endlinehere startlinehere soon they die the flowers insects live a day clouds dissolve in showers only waves at play last forever endlinehere startlinehere shall endeavor make a sea of purpose mightier than we dream to day endlinehere startlinehere he whistled a little frivolous tune which he felt to be pulsing with ecstasy for he thought that success always followed desire such a very superlative fool was he endlinehere startlinehere a maiden came by on an ambling mule her gown was rose red and her kerchief blue on her lap she carried a basket of eggs endlinehere startlinehere thought the fool there is certainly room for two endlinehere startlinehere so he jauntily swaggered towards the maid and put out his hand to the bridle rein endlinehere startlinehere my pretty girl quoth the fool take me up for to ride with you to the town i am fain endlinehere startlinehere but the maiden struck at his upraised arm and pelted him hotly with eggs a score endlinehere startlinehere the mule lashed into a fury ran the fool went back to his stone and swore endlinehere startlinehere then out of the cloud of settling dust the burly form of an abbot appeared reading his office he rode to the town endlinehere startlinehere and the fool got up for his heart was cheered endlinehere startlinehere he stood in the midst of the long white road and swept off his cap till it touched the ground endlinehere startlinehere ah reverent sir well met said the fool a worthier transport never was found endlinehere startlinehere i pray you allow me to mount with you your palfrey seems both sturdy and young endlinehere startlinehere the abbot looked up from the holy book and cried out in anger hold your tongue endlinehere startlinehere how dare you obstruct the kings highroad you saucy varlet get out of my way endlinehere startlinehere then he gave the fool a cut with his whip and leaving him smarting he rode away endlinehere startlinehere the fool was angry the fool was sore and he cursed the folly of monks and maids endlinehere startlinehere if i could but meet with a man sighed the fool for a woman fears and a friar upbraids endlinehere startlinehere then he saw a flashing of distant steel and the clanking of harness greeted his ears and up the road journeyed knights at arms with waving plumes and glittering spears endlinehere startlinehere the fool took notice and slowly arose not quite so sure was his foolish heart endlinehere startlinehere if priests and women would none of him was it likely a knight would take his part endlinehere startlinehere they sang as they rode these lusty boys when one chanced to turn toward the highways side theres a sorry figure of fun jested he well sirrah endlinehere startlinehere move back there is scarce room to ride endlinehere startlinehere then the company halted and laughed out loud endlinehere startlinehere was such a request ever made to a knight endlinehere startlinehere and where are your legs asked one if you start you may be inside the town gates to night endlinehere startlinehere t is a lazy fellow let him alone theyve no room in the town for such idlers as he endlinehere startlinehere but one bent from his saddle and said my man art thou not ashamed to beg charity endlinehere startlinehere thou art well set up and thy legs are strong but it much misgives me lest thourt a fool for beggars get only a beggars crust wise men are reared in a different school endlinehere startlinehere purple tree shadows crept over the road the level sun flung an orange light and the fool laid his head on the hard gray stone and wept as he realized advancing night endlinehere startlinehere a great round moon rose over a hill and the steady wind blew yet more cool and crouched on a stone a wayfarer sobbed for at last he knew he was only a fool endlinehere startlinehere the stars hang thick in the apple tree the south wind smells of the pungent sea gold tulip cups are heavy with dew endlinehere startlinehere the nights for you sweetheart for you endlinehere startlinehere starfire rains from the vaulted blue endlinehere startlinehere the dancing of unseen leaves endlinehere startlinehere a drowsy swallow stirs in the eaves endlinehere startlinehere only a maiden is sorrowing endlinehere startlinehere t is night and spring sweetheart and spring endlinehere startlinehere starfire lights your hearts blossoming endlinehere startlinehere in the intimate dark theres never an ear though the tulips stand on tiptoe to hear so give ripe fruit must shrivel or fall endlinehere startlinehere as you are mine sweetheart give all endlinehere startlinehere starfire sparkles your coronal endlinehere startlinehere what is poetry endlinehere startlinehere is it a mosaic of coloured stones which curiously are wrought into a pattern endlinehere startlinehere softly the water ripples against the canoes curving side softly the birch trees rustle flinging over us branches wide endlinehere startlinehere from the shore come the scents of a garden and between a gap in the trees a proud white statue glimmers in cold disdainful ease endlinehere startlinehere the child of a southern people the thought of an alien race what does she in this pale northern garden how reconcile it with her grace endlinehere startlinehere but the moon in her wayward beauty is ever and always the same as lovely as when upon latmos she watched till endymion came endlinehere startlinehere through the water the moon writes her legends in light on the smooth wet sand they endure for a moment and vanish and no one may understand endlinehere startlinehere all round us the secret of nature is telling itself to our sight we may guess at her meaning but never can know the full mystery of night endlinehere startlinehere but her power of enchantment is on us we bow to the spell which she weaves made up of the murmur of waves and the manifold whisper of leaves endlinehere startlinehere to me it is not so endlinehere startlinehere to me alone it is a time of pause a void and silent space between two worlds when inspiration lags and feeling sleeps gathering strength for efforts yet to come endlinehere startlinehere for life alone is creator of life and closest contact with the human world is like a lantern shining in the night to light me to a knowledge of myself endlinehere startlinehere as for a moment he stands in hardy masculine beauty poised on the fircrested rock over the pool which below him gleams in the wavering sunlight waiting the shock of his plunging endlinehere startlinehere so for a moment i stand my feet planted firm in the present eagerly scanning the future which is so soon to possess me endlinehere startlinehere later the solitude vanished confused and distracted the road where many were seeking and jostling endlinehere startlinehere left behind were the trees and the flowers the half realized beauty of quiet the sacred unconscious communing endlinehere startlinehere and now he is come to a river a line of gray sullen water not blue and splashing but dark rolling somberly on to the ocean endlinehere startlinehere but on the far side is a city whose windows flame gold in the sunset endlinehere startlinehere be strong to uphold him and bear him across to the city the beautiful city whose spires still glow with the fires of sunset endlinehere startlinehere look dear how bright the moonlight is to night endlinehere startlinehere see where it casts the shadow of that tree far out upon the grass endlinehere startlinehere it seems as though the garden which you love were like a swinging censer its incense floating before us as a reverent act to sanctify and bless our night of love endlinehere startlinehere i need to hear it often for my heart doubts naturally and finds it hard to trust endlinehere startlinehere ah dearest you are good to love me so and yet i would not have it goodness rather excess of selfishness in you to need me through and through as flowers need the sun endlinehere startlinehere has your life too been waiting for this time not only mine the sharpness of this joy endlinehere startlinehere dear heart i love you worship you as though i were a priest before a holy shrine endlinehere startlinehere im glad that you are beautiful although were you not lovely still i needs must love but you are all things it must have been so for otherwise it were not you endlinehere startlinehere come close when you are in the circle of my arm faith grows a mountain and i take my stand upon its utmost top endlinehere startlinehere yes yes once more kiss me and let me feel you very near wanting me wholly even as i want you endlinehere startlinehere have years behind been dark endlinehere startlinehere will those to come bring unguessed sorrows into our two lives endlinehere startlinehere what does it matter we have had to night endlinehere startlinehere to night will make us strong for we believe each in the other this is a sacrament endlinehere startlinehere i know a country laced with roads they join the hills and they span the brooks they weave like a shuttle between broad fields and slide discreetly through hidden nooks endlinehere startlinehere they are canopied like a persian dome and carpeted with orient dyes endlinehere startlinehere they are myriad voiced and musical and scented with happiest memories endlinehere startlinehere o winding roads that i know so well every twist and turn every hollow and hill endlinehere startlinehere they are set in my heart to a pulsing tune gay as a honey bee humming in june endlinehere startlinehere o uphill roads and roads that dip down endlinehere startlinehere you curl your sun spattered length along and your march is beaten into a song by the softly ringing hoofs of a horse and the panting breath of the dogs i love endlinehere startlinehere the pageant of autumn follows its course and the blue sky of autumn laughs above endlinehere startlinehere and the song and the country become as one i see it as music i hear it as light prismatic and shimmering trembling to tone the land of desire my souls delight endlinehere startlinehere and always it beats in my listening ears with the gentle thud of a horses stride with the swift falling steps of many dogs following following at my side endlinehere startlinehere o roads that journey to fairyland endlinehere startlinehere how still it is endlinehere startlinehere what sound is that which echoes through the wood endlinehere startlinehere is it the reedy note of an oaten pipe endlinehere startlinehere perchance a minute more will see the brood of the shaggy forest god and on his lip will rest the rushes he is wont to play endlinehere startlinehere his train in woven baskets bear ripe fruit and weave a dance with ropes of gray acorns so light their touch the grasses scarcely sway as they the measure tread to the lilting flute endlinehere startlinehere t is only fancy thus adorns endlinehere startlinehere a cloud drifts idly over the shining sun endlinehere startlinehere how damp it seems how silent still and strange endlinehere startlinehere surely t was here some tragedy was done and here the chorus sang each coming change endlinehere startlinehere the tread of sandalled feet comes noiselessly endlinehere startlinehere the silence almost is a sound and dreams take on the semblances of finite things so potent is the spell that what but seems elsewhere is lifted here on fancys wings endlinehere startlinehere the little woodland theatre seems to wait all tremulous with hope and wistful joy for something that is sure to come at last some deep emotion satisfying great endlinehere startlinehere it grows a living presence bold and shy cradling the future in a glorious past endlinehere startlinehere the octagon tower casts a shade cool and gray like a cutlass blade in sun baked vines the cicalas spin the little green lizards run out and in endlinehere startlinehere a sail dips over the oceans rim and bubbles rise to the fountains brim endlinehere startlinehere slowly she walks to the balustrade idly notes how the blossoms fade in the suns caress then crosses where the shadow shelters a carven chair endlinehere startlinehere within its curve supine she lies and wearily closes her tired eyes endlinehere startlinehere the minstrel beseeches his silver strings and holding the lady spellbound sings down the road to avignon the long long road to avignon across the bridge to avignon one morning in the spring endlinehere startlinehere clouds sail over the distant trees petals are shaken down by the breeze they fall on the terrace tiles like snow the sighing of waves sounds far below endlinehere startlinehere a humming bird kisses the lips of a rose then laden with honey and love he goes endlinehere startlinehere step by step and he comes to her fearful lest she suddenly stir endlinehere startlinehere sunshine and silence and each to each the lute and his singing their only speech he leans above her her eyes unclose the humming bird enters another rose endlinehere startlinehere the minstrel hushes his silver strings endlinehere startlinehere the beating of humming birds wings endlinehere startlinehere down the road to avignon the long long road to avignon across the bridge to avignon one morning in the spring endlinehere startlinehere i hear the sigh the goaded city gives not day nor night can ease her heart her anguished labours stay endlinehere startlinehere below straight streets monotonous from north and south from east and west stretch glittering and luminous above one tower tops the rest and holds aloft mans constant quest time endlinehere startlinehere joyless emblem of the greed of millions robber of the best which earth can give the vulgar creed has seared upon the night its flaming ruthless screed endlinehere startlinehere whose soothing presence brings the quiet shining of the stars endlinehere startlinehere whose cloak of darkness clings so intimately close that scars are hid from our own eyes endlinehere startlinehere beggars by day our wealth is having night to burn our souls before altars dim and tree shadowed where the light is shed from a young moon mysteriously bright endlinehere startlinehere where art thou hiding where thy peace endlinehere startlinehere this is the hour but thou art not endlinehere startlinehere will waking tumult never cease endlinehere startlinehere hast thou thy votary forgot endlinehere startlinehere nature forsakes this man begot and festering wilderness and now the long still hours are here no jot of dear communing do i know instead the glaring man filled city groans below endlinehere startlinehere on winter nights beside the nursery fire we read the fairy tale while glowing coals builded its pictures endlinehere startlinehere the foliage seemed to rustle in the wind a silent murmur carved in still gray stone endlinehere startlinehere a sudden blare of trumpets and the throng about the entrance parted as the guests filed singly in with rare and precious gifts endlinehere startlinehere our eager fancies noted all they brought the glorious unattainable delights endlinehere startlinehere but always there was one unbidden guest who cursed the child and left it bitterness endlinehere startlinehere the fire falls asunder all is changed i am no more a child and what i see is not a fairy tale but life my life endlinehere startlinehere the gifts are there the many pleasant things health wealth long settled friendships with a name which honors all who bear it and the power of making words obedient endlinehere startlinehere this is much but overshadowing all is still the curse that never shall i be fulfilled by love endlinehere startlinehere along the parching highroad of the world no other soul shall bear mine company endlinehere startlinehere so i behold my visions on the ground no longer radiant an ignoble heap of broken dusty glass endlinehere startlinehere and so unlit even by hope or faith my dragging steps force me forever through the passing days endlinehere startlinehere you came to me bearing bright roses red like the wine of your heart you twisted them into a garland to set me aside from the mart endlinehere startlinehere red roses to crown me your lover and i walked aureoled and apart endlinehere startlinehere enslaved and encircled i bore it proud token of my gift to you endlinehere startlinehere the petals waned paler and shriveled and dropped and the thorns started through endlinehere startlinehere bitter thorns to proclaim me your lover a diadem woven with rue endlinehere startlinehere dear bessie would my tired rhyme had force to rise from apathy and shaking off its lethargy ring word tones like a christmas chime endlinehere startlinehere but in my souls high belfry chill the bitter wind of doubt has blown the summer swallows all have flown the bells are frost bound mute and still endlinehere startlinehere upon the crumbling boards the snow has drifted deep the clappers hang prismed with icicles their clang unheard since ages long ago endlinehere startlinehere the rope i pull is stiff and cold my straining ears detect no sound except a sigh as round and round the wind rocks through the timbers old endlinehere startlinehere below i know the church is bright with haloed tapers warm with prayer but here i only feel the air of icy centuries of night endlinehere startlinehere beneath my feet the snow is lit and gemmed with colours red and blue topaz and green where light falls through the saints that in the windows sit endlinehere startlinehere here darkness seems a spectred thing voiceless and haunting while the stars mock with a light of long dead years the ache of present suffering endlinehere startlinehere silent and winter killed i stand no carol hymns my debt to you but take this frozen thought in lieu and thaw its music in your hand endlinehere startlinehere thou father of the children of my brain by thee engendered in my willing heart how can i thank thee for this gift of art poured out so lavishly and not in vain endlinehere startlinehere what thou created never more can die thy fructifying power lives in me and i conceive knowing it is by thee dear other parent of my poetry endlinehere startlinehere all unknown by me unguessed by thee not even dreamed a tree has blossomed in a night that seemed of stubborn barren wood endlinehere startlinehere for thou hast sown this seed of beauty in a ground of truth endlinehere startlinehere humbly i dedicate myself and yet i tremble with a sudden fear to set new music ringing through my fading youth endlinehere startlinehere his eyelids burnt and quivered with the strain of looking and against his temples beat the all enshrouding suffocating dark endlinehere startlinehere he stumbled lurched and struck against a door that opened and a howl of obscene mirth grated his senses wallowing on the floor lay men and dogs and women in the dirt endlinehere startlinehere he sickened loathing it and as he gazed the candle guttered flared and then went out endlinehere startlinehere then as he leaned unconscious where the great oak door blew back and cast him bruised and dripping in the church endlinehere startlinehere his eyes from long sojourning in the night were blinded now as by some glorious sun he slowly crawled toward the altar steps endlinehere startlinehere he could not think for heavy in his ears an organ boomed majestic harmonies he only knew that what he saw was light endlinehere startlinehere he bowed himself before a cross of flame and shut his eyes in fear lest it should fade endlinehere startlinehere blue through the window burns the twilight heavy through trees blows the warm south wind endlinehere startlinehere glistening against the chill gray sky light wet black branches are barred and entwined endlinehere startlinehere sodden and spongy the scarce green grass plot dents into pools where a foot has been endlinehere startlinehere puddles lie spilt in the road a mass not of water but steel with its cold hard sheen endlinehere startlinehere faint fades the fire on the hearth its embers scattering wide at a stronger gust endlinehere startlinehere above the old weathercock groans but remembers creaking to turn in its centuried rust endlinehere startlinehere dying forlorn in dreary sorrow wrapping the mists round her withering form day sinks down and in darkness to morrow travails to birth in the womb of the storm endlinehere startlinehere deeps of unhewn woods alone can cherish thee alone possess thy quiet teeming vigor endlinehere startlinehere this our crime not to have worshipped marred by alien moods that sole condition of all loveliness the dreaming lapse of slow unmeasured time endlinehere startlinehere dawn fills the room and penetrating bright the silent sunbeams through the window pour endlinehere startlinehere and she lies sleeping ignorant of fate enmeshed in listless dreams her soul not yet ripened to bear the purport of this day endlinehere startlinehere the morning breeze scarce stirs the coverlet a shadow falls across the sunlight wait endlinehere startlinehere a lark is singing as he flies away endlinehere startlinehere beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun scorching against the blue flame of the sky endlinehere startlinehere brown lily pads lie heavy and supine within a granite basin under one the bronze gold glimmer of a carp and i reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine endlinehere startlinehere another year is quick with import endlinehere startlinehere such each year has been endlinehere startlinehere unmoved thou watchest all and all bequeath some jewel to thy diadem of power thou pledge of greater majesty unseen endlinehere startlinehere a little garden on a bleak hillside where deep the heavy dazzling mountain snow lies far into the spring endlinehere startlinehere the suns pale glow is scarcely able to melt patches wide about the single rose bush endlinehere startlinehere all denied of natures tender ministries endlinehere startlinehere but no for wonder working faith has made it blow with flowers many hued and starry eyed endlinehere startlinehere a little garden loved with a great love endlinehere startlinehere thou yellow trumpeter of laggard spring endlinehere startlinehere thou herald of rich summers myriad flowers endlinehere startlinehere always bold to stand erect full in the dazzling play of aprils sun for thou hast caught his gold endlinehere startlinehere t is you that are the music not your song endlinehere startlinehere the song is but a door which opening wide lets forth the pent up melody inside your spirits harmony which clear and strong sings but of you endlinehere startlinehere throughout your whole life long your songs your thoughts your doings each divide this perfect beauty waves within a tide or single notes amid a glorious throng endlinehere startlinehere the song of earth has many different chords ocean has many moods and many tones yet always ocean endlinehere startlinehere in the damp spring woods the painted trillium smiles while crisp pine cones autumn alone can ripen endlinehere startlinehere so is this one music with a thousand cadences endlinehere startlinehere so still it stands surely our own if we exert our might endlinehere startlinehere never canst thou grasp this fleeting gleam its glowing flame would die if it were caught its value is that it doth always seem but just a little farther on endlinehere startlinehere distraught but lighted ever onward we are brought upon our way unknowing in a dream endlinehere startlinehere brave idolatry which can conceive a hero endlinehere startlinehere no deceit no knowledge taught by unrelenting years can quench this fierce untamable desire endlinehere startlinehere we know that what we long for once achieved will cease to satisfy endlinehere startlinehere be still our fears if what we worship fail us still the fire burns on and it is much to have believed endlinehere startlinehere must all of worth be travailled for and those lifes brightest stars rise from a troubled sea endlinehere startlinehere must years go by in sad uncertainty leaving us doubting whose the conquering blows are we or fate the victors endlinehere startlinehere time which shows all inner meanings will reveal but we shall never know the upshot endlinehere startlinehere sudden we lack the flash of insight life grows drear and gray and hour follows hour nerveless slack endlinehere startlinehere austere arbiter of each mans fate by whom he learns that natures steadfast laws are as decrees immutable o pause your even forward march endlinehere startlinehere not yet too late teach me the needed lesson when to wait inactive as a ship when no wind draws to stretch the loosened cordage endlinehere startlinehere what instinct forces man to journey on urged by a longing blind but dominant endlinehere startlinehere nothing he sees can hold him nothing daunt his never failing eagerness endlinehere startlinehere the sun setting in splendour every night has won his vassalage those towers flamboyant of airy cloudland palaces now haunt his daylight wanderings endlinehere startlinehere the wind is singing through the trees to night a deep voiced song of rushing cadences and crashing intervals endlinehere startlinehere above the tossing trees shines down a star quietly bright this wild tumultuous joy quickens nor dims its splendour endlinehere startlinehere and my mind o star endlinehere startlinehere is filled with your white light from far so suffer me this one night to enjoy the freedom of the onward sweeping wind endlinehere startlinehere the path runs straight between the flowering rows a moonlit path hemmed in by beds of bloom where phlox and marigolds dispute for room with tall red dahlias and the briar rose endlinehere startlinehere t is reckless prodigality which throws into the night these wafts of rich perfume which sweep across the garden like a plume endlinehere startlinehere over the trees a single bright star glows endlinehere startlinehere how is it that being gone you fill my days and all the long nights are made glad by thee endlinehere startlinehere no loneliness is this nor misery but great content that these should be the ways whereby the fancy dreaming as she strays makes bright and present what she would would be endlinehere startlinehere and who shall say if the reality is not with dreams so pregnant endlinehere startlinehere it may be vain illusion endlinehere startlinehere alas how few there are who strike in us a chord we knew existed but so seldom heard its tone we tremble at the half forgotten sound endlinehere startlinehere the world is full of rude awakenings and heaven born castles shattered to the ground yet still our human longing vainly clings to a belief in beauty through all wrongs endlinehere startlinehere o stay your hand and leave my heart its songs endlinehere startlinehere what torture lurks within a single thought when grown too constant and however kind however welcome still the weary mind aches with its presence endlinehere startlinehere dull remembrance taught remembers on unceasingly unsought the old delight is with us but to find that all recurring joy is pain refined become a habit and we struggle caught endlinehere startlinehere you lie upon my heart as on a nest folded in peace for you can never know how crushed i am with having you at rest heavy upon my life endlinehere startlinehere i love you so you bind my freedom from its rightful quest endlinehere startlinehere in mercy lift your drooping wings and go endlinehere startlinehere i do not care to talk to you although your speech evokes a thousand sympathies and all my beings silent harmonies wake trembling into music endlinehere startlinehere when you go it is as if some sudden dreadful blow had severed all the strings with savage ease endlinehere startlinehere no do not talk but let us rather seize this intimate gift of silence which we know endlinehere startlinehere others may guess your thoughts from what you say as storms are guessed from clouds where darkness broods endlinehere startlinehere to me the very essence of the day reveals its inner purpose and its moods as poplars feel the rain and then straightway reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods endlinehere startlinehere now you are come endlinehere startlinehere you tremble like a star poised where behind earths rim the sun has set endlinehere startlinehere your voice has sung across my heart but numb and mute i have no tones to answer endlinehere startlinehere far within i kneel before you speechless yet and life ablaze with beauty i am dumb endlinehere startlinehere how empty seems the town now you are gone endlinehere startlinehere a wilderness of sad streets where gaunt walls hide nothing to desire sunshine falls eery distorted as it long had shone on white dead faces tombed in halls of stone endlinehere startlinehere the whir of motors stricken through with calls of playing boys floats up at intervals but all these noises blur to one long moan endlinehere startlinehere what quest is worth pursuing endlinehere startlinehere and how strange that other men still go accustomed ways endlinehere startlinehere i hate their interest in the things they do endlinehere startlinehere a spectre horde repeating without change an old routine endlinehere startlinehere alone i know the days are still born and the world stopped lacking you endlinehere startlinehere all night i wrestled with a memory which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought endlinehere startlinehere the crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought its disillusion now i only cry for peace for power to forget the lie which hope too long has whispered endlinehere startlinehere so i sought the sleep which would not come and night was fraught with old emotions weeping silently endlinehere startlinehere i heard your voice again and knew the things which you had promised proved an empty vaunt endlinehere startlinehere i felt your clinging hands while nights broad wings cherished our love in darkness endlinehere startlinehere from the lawn a sudden quivering birdnote like a taunt endlinehere startlinehere my arms held nothing but the empty dawn endlinehere startlinehere to make a pavement for your feet i stripped my soul for you to walk upon and slipped beneath your steps to soften all your ways endlinehere startlinehere but now my letters are like blossoms pale we strew upon a grave with hopeless tears endlinehere startlinehere i ask no recompense i shall not fail although you do not heed the long sad years still pass and still i scatter flowers frail and whisper words of love which no one hears endlinehere startlinehere throughout the echoing chambers of my brain i hear your words in mournful cadence toll like some slow passing bell which warns the soul of sundering darkness endlinehere startlinehere unrelenting fain to batter down resistance fall again stroke after stroke insistent diastole the bitter blows of truth until the whole is hammered into fact made strangely plain endlinehere startlinehere where shall i look for comfort endlinehere startlinehere our worlds are drawn apart our spirits suns divided and the light of mine burnt dim endlinehere startlinehere now in the haunted twilight i must do your will endlinehere startlinehere i grasp the cup which over runs and with my trembling lips i touch the rim endlinehere startlinehere i cant get out said the starling endlinehere startlinehere sternes sentimental journey endlinehere startlinehere forever the impenetrable wall of self confines my poor rebellious soul i never see the towering white clouds roll before a sturdy wind save through the small barred window of my jail endlinehere startlinehere i live a thrall with all my outer life a clipped square hole rectangular a fraction of a scroll unwound and winding like a worsted ball endlinehere startlinehere my thoughts are grown uneager and depressed through being always mine my fancys wings are moulted and the feathers blown away endlinehere startlinehere i weary for desires never guessed for alien passions strange imaginings to be some other person for a day endlinehere startlinehere white glittering sunlight fills the market square spotted and sprigged with shadows endlinehere startlinehere the market glows and flaunts and clatters in its busy care endlinehere startlinehere the law of duty urged that he should roam should sail from fog and chilly airs to skies clear with deceitful welcome endlinehere startlinehere he had come with proud resolve but still his lonely eyes ached with fatigue at never seeing home endlinehere startlinehere smoulderings of sacrificial fires burst their rings and blotted out in smoke his lost domain endlinehere startlinehere bereft of courtiers only with his queen from empty palace down to empty quay endlinehere startlinehere no challenge screamed from hostile carabine endlinehere startlinehere boyish sympathetic man endlinehere startlinehere crumbled before thy majesty we bow endlinehere startlinehere the little gallery winds round about the middle of a most secluded room midway between the ceiling and the floor endlinehere startlinehere for books are more than books they are the life the very heart and core of ages past the reason why men lived and worked and died the essence and quintessence of their lives endlinehere startlinehere silently waiting that from time to time it may be given them to illuminate dull daily facts with pristine radiance for some long waited for affinity who lingers yet in the deep womb of time endlinehere startlinehere the shifting sun pierces the young green leaves of elm trees newly coming into bud and splashes on the floor and on the books through old high rounded windows dim with age endlinehere startlinehere the noisy city sounds of modern life float softened to us across the old graveyard endlinehere startlinehere the room is filled with a warm mellow light no garish colours jar on our content the books upon the shelves are old and worn endlinehere startlinehere t was no belated effort nor attempt to keep abreast with old as well as new that placed them here tricked in a modern guise easily got and held in light esteem endlinehere startlinehere a nothing truly yet a link that binds all ages to their own inheritance and stretching backward dim and dimmer still is lost in a remote antiquity endlinehere startlinehere grapes do not come of thorns nor figs of thistles and even a great poets divinest thought is coloured by the world he knows and sees endlinehere startlinehere nay the little things of daily life it is which mold and shape and make him apt for noble deeds and true endlinehere startlinehere the long still fruitful hours slip away shedding their influences as they pass we know ourselves the richer to have sat upon this dusty floor and dreamed our dreams endlinehere startlinehere no other place to us were quite the same no other dreams so potent in their charm for this is ours endlinehere startlinehere the building simply bodies forth a thought peculiarly inherent to the race endlinehere startlinehere and we descendants of that elder time have learnt to love the very form in which the thought has been embodied to our years endlinehere startlinehere it takes some time for moss and vines to grow and warmly cover gaunt and chill stone walls of stately buildings from the cold north wind endlinehere startlinehere the lichen of affection takes as long or longer ere it lovingly enfolds a place which since without it were bereft all stript and bare shorn of its chiefest grace endlinehere startlinehere sea shell sea shell sing me a song o please endlinehere startlinehere sea shell sea shell sing of the things you know so well endlinehere startlinehere near where i live there is a lake as blue as blue can be winds make it dance as they go blowing by endlinehere startlinehere i think it curtseys to the sky endlinehere startlinehere its just a lake of lovely flowers and my mamma says they are ours but they are not like those we grow to be our very own you know endlinehere startlinehere we have a splendid garden there are lots of flowers everywhere roses and pinks and four oclocks and hollyhocks and evening stocks endlinehere startlinehere mamma lets us pick them but never must we pick any gentians ever endlinehere startlinehere for if we carried them away theyd die of homesickness that day endlinehere startlinehere my grandpapa lives in a wonderful house with a great many windows and doors there are stairs that go up and stairs that go down and such beautiful slippery floors endlinehere startlinehere but of all of the rooms even mothers and mine and the bookroom and parlour and all i like the green dining room so much the best because of its ceiling and wall endlinehere startlinehere right over your head is a funny round hole with apples and pears falling through theres a big bunch of grapes all purply and sweet and melons and pineapples too endlinehere startlinehere they tumble and tumble but never come down though ive stood underneath a long while with my mouth open wide for i always have hoped just a cherry would drop from the pile endlinehere startlinehere no matter how early i run there to look it has always begun to fall through and one night when at bedtime i crept in to see it was falling by candle light too endlinehere startlinehere i am sure they are magical fruits and each one makes you hear things or see things or go forever invisible but its no use and of course i shall just never know endlinehere startlinehere for the ladders too heavy to lift and the chairs are not nearly so tall as i need endlinehere startlinehere ive given up hope and i feel i shall die without having accomplished the deed endlinehere startlinehere its a little bit sad when you seem very near to adventures and things of that sort which nearly begin and then dont and you know it is only because you are short endlinehere startlinehere slipping softly through the sky little horned happy moon can you hear me up so high endlinehere startlinehere will you come down soon endlinehere startlinehere on my nursery window sill will you stay your steady flight endlinehere startlinehere and then float away with me through the summer night endlinehere startlinehere brushing over tops of trees playing hide and seek with stars peeping up through shiny clouds at jupiter or mars endlinehere startlinehere i shall fill my lap with roses gathered in the milky way all to carry home to mother endlinehere startlinehere what will she say endlinehere startlinehere little rocking sailing moon do you hear me shout ahoy endlinehere startlinehere just a little nearer moon to please a little boy endlinehere startlinehere high up in the apple tree climbing i go with the sky above me the earth below endlinehere startlinehere each branch is the step of a wonderful stair which leads to the town i see shining up there endlinehere startlinehere climbing climbing higher and higher the branches blow and i see a spire the gleam of a turret the glint of a dome all sparkling and bright like white sea foam endlinehere startlinehere on and on from bough to bough the leaves are thick but i push my way through before i have always had to stop but to day i am sure i shall reach the top endlinehere startlinehere today to the end of the marvelous stair where those glittering pinacles flash in the air endlinehere startlinehere climbing climbing higher i go with the sky close above me the earth far below endlinehere startlinehere naughty little speckled trout cant i coax you to come out endlinehere startlinehere is it such great fun to play in the water every day endlinehere startlinehere do you pull the naiads hair hiding in the lilies there endlinehere startlinehere do you hunt for fishes eggs or watch tadpoles grow their legs endlinehere startlinehere do the little trouts have school in some deep sun glinted pool and in recess play at tag round that bed of purple flag endlinehere startlinehere i have tried so hard to catch you hours and hours ive sat to watch you but you never will come out naughty little speckled trout endlinehere startlinehere he shouts in the sails of the ships at sea he steals the down from the honeybee he makes the forest trees rustle and sing he twirls my kite till it breaks its string endlinehere startlinehere laughing dancing sunny wind whistling howling rainy wind north south east and west each is the wind i like the best endlinehere startlinehere he calls up the fog and hides the hills he whirls the wings of the great windmills the weathercocks love him and turn to discover his whereabouts but hes gone the rover endlinehere startlinehere the pine trees toss him their cones with glee the flowers bend low in courtesy each wave flings up a shower of pearls the flag in front of the school unfurls endlinehere startlinehere by day you cannot see the sky for it is up so very high endlinehere startlinehere you look and look but its so blue that you can never see right through endlinehere startlinehere but when night comes it is quite plain and all the stars are there again endlinehere startlinehere they seem just like old friends to me ive known them all my life you see endlinehere startlinehere there is the dipper first and there is cassiopeia in her chair orions belt the milky way and lots i know but cannot say endlinehere startlinehere one group looks like a swarm of bees papa says theyre the pleiades but i think they must be the toy of some nice little angel boy endlinehere startlinehere perhaps his jackstones which to day he has forgot to put away and left them lying on the sky where he will find them bye and bye endlinehere startlinehere i wish hed come and play with me endlinehere startlinehere wed have such fun for it would be a most unusual thing for boys to feel that they had stars for toys endlinehere startlinehere we grasp our battle spears we don our breast plates of hide endlinehere startlinehere the axles of our chariots touch our short swords meet endlinehere startlinehere standards obscure the sun the foe roll up like clouds endlinehere startlinehere arrows fall thick the warriors press forward endlinehere startlinehere they menace our ranks they break our line endlinehere startlinehere the left hand trace horse is dead the one on the right is smitten endlinehere startlinehere the fallen horses block our wheels they impede the yoke horses endlinehere startlinehere they grasp their jade drum sticks they beat the sounding drums endlinehere startlinehere heaven decrees their fall the dread powers are angry endlinehere startlinehere the warriors are all dead they lie on the moor field endlinehere startlinehere they issued but shall not enter they went but shall not return endlinehere startlinehere the plains are flat and wide the way home is long endlinehere startlinehere their swords lie beside them their black bows in their hand endlinehere startlinehere though their limbs were torn their hearts could not be repressed endlinehere startlinehere they were more than brave they were inspired with the spirit of wu endlinehere startlinehere steadfast to the end they could not be daunted endlinehere startlinehere their bodies were stricken but their souls have taken immortality captains among the ghosts heroes among the dead endlinehere startlinehere to be an orphan to be fated to be an orphan endlinehere startlinehere how bitter is this lot endlinehere startlinehere when my father and mother were alive i used to ride in a carriage with four fine horses endlinehere startlinehere but when they both died my brother and sister in law sent me out to be a merchant endlinehere startlinehere in the south i travelled to the nine rivers and in the east as far as chi and lu endlinehere startlinehere my brother told me to get ready the dinner endlinehere startlinehere my sister in law told me to see after the horses endlinehere startlinehere i was always going up into the hall and running down again to the parlour endlinehere startlinehere my tears fell like rain endlinehere startlinehere in the morning they sent me to draw water i didnt get back till night fall endlinehere startlinehere my hands were all sore and i had no shoes endlinehere startlinehere i walked the cold earth treading on thorns and brambles endlinehere startlinehere as i stopped to pull out the thorns how bitter my heart was endlinehere startlinehere my tears fell and fell and i went on sobbing and sobbing endlinehere startlinehere in winter i have no great coat nor in summer thin clothes endlinehere startlinehere it is no pleasure to be alive endlinehere startlinehere i had rather quickly leave the earth and go beneath the yellow springs endlinehere startlinehere the april winds blow and the grass is growing green endlinehere startlinehere in the third month silkworms and mulberries in the sixth month the melon harvest endlinehere startlinehere i went out with the melon cart and just as i was coming home the melon cart turned over endlinehere startlinehere the people who came to help me were few but the people who ate the melons were many all they left me was the stalks to take home as fast as i could endlinehere startlinehere my brother and sister in law were harsh they asked me all sorts of awful questions endlinehere startlinehere why does everyone in the village hate me endlinehere startlinehere i want to write a letter and send it to my mother and father under the earth and tell them i cant go on any longer living with my brother and sister in law endlinehere startlinehere she had been ill for years and years she sent for me to say something endlinehere startlinehere she couldnt say what she wanted because of the tears that kept coming of themselves endlinehere startlinehere i have burdened you with orphan children with orphan children two or three endlinehere startlinehere dont let our children go hungry or cold if they do wrong dont slap or beat them endlinehere startlinehere when you take out the baby rock it in your arms endlinehere startlinehere last she said when i carried them in my arms they had no clothes and now their jackets have no linings endlinehere startlinehere _ i shut the doors and barred the windows and left the motherless children endlinehere startlinehere when i got to the market and met my friends i wept endlinehere startlinehere i sat down and could not go with them endlinehere startlinehere i asked them to buy some cakes for my children endlinehere startlinehere in the presence of my friends i sobbed and cried endlinehere startlinehere i tried not to grieve but sorrow would not cease endlinehere startlinehere i felt in my pocket and gave my friends some money endlinehere startlinehere when i got home i found my children calling to be taken into their mothers arms endlinehere startlinehere i walked up and down in the empty room this way and that a long while endlinehere startlinehere then i went away from it and said to myself i will forget and never speak of her again endlinehere startlinehere in the eastern quarter dawn breaks the stars flicker pale endlinehere startlinehere the morning cock at ju nan mounts the wall and crows endlinehere startlinehere the songs are over the clock run down but still the feast is set endlinehere startlinehere the moon grows dim and the stars are few morning has come to the world endlinehere startlinehere at a thousand gates and ten thousand doors the fish shaped keys turn round the palace and up by the castle the crows and magpies are flying endlinehere startlinehere we go to the golden palace we set out the jade cups endlinehere startlinehere we summon the honoured guests to enter at the golden gate endlinehere startlinehere they enter at the golden gate and go to the golden hall endlinehere startlinehere in the eastern kitchen the meat is sliced and ready roast beef and boiled pork and mutton endlinehere startlinehere the master of the feast hands round the wine endlinehere startlinehere the harp players sound their clear chords endlinehere startlinehere the cups are pushed aside and we face each other at chess the rival pawns are marshalled rank against rank endlinehere startlinehere the fire glows and the smoke puffs and curls from the incense burner rises a delicate fragrance endlinehere startlinehere the clear wine has made our cheeks red round the table joy and peace prevail endlinehere startlinehere may those who shared in this days delight through countless autumns enjoy like felicity endlinehere startlinehere at fifteen i went with the army at fourscore i came home endlinehere startlinehere on the way i met a man from the village i asked him who there was at home endlinehere startlinehere that over there is your house all covered over with trees and bushes endlinehere startlinehere rabbits had run in at the dog hole pheasants flew down from the beams of the roof endlinehere startlinehere in the courtyard was growing some wild grain and by the well some wild mallows endlinehere startlinehere ill boil the grain and make porridge ill pluck the mallows and make soup endlinehere startlinehere soup and porridge are both cooked but there is no one to eat them with endlinehere startlinehere i went out and looked towards the east while tears fell and wetted my clothes endlinehere startlinehere in a narrow road where there was not room to pass my carriage met the carriage of a young man endlinehere startlinehere and while his axle was touching my axle in the narrow road i asked him where he lived endlinehere startlinehere the place where i live is easy enough to find easy to find and difficult to forget endlinehere startlinehere in the midst of the courtyard grows a cassia tree and candles on its branches flaring away in the night endlinehere startlinehere they fought south of the castle they died north of the wall endlinehere startlinehere they died in the moors and were not buried endlinehere startlinehere their flesh was the food of crows endlinehere startlinehere tell the crows we are not afraid we have died in the moors and cannot be buried endlinehere startlinehere crows how can our bodies escape you endlinehere startlinehere the waters flowed deep and the rushes in the pool were dark endlinehere startlinehere the riders fought and were slain their horses wander neighing endlinehere startlinehere by the bridge there was a house endlinehere startlinehere was it south was it north endlinehere startlinehere the harvest was never gathered endlinehere startlinehere how can we give you your offerings endlinehere startlinehere you served your prince faithfully though all in vain endlinehere startlinehere i think of you faithful soldiers your service shall not be forgotten endlinehere startlinehere for in the morning you went out to battle and at night you did not return endlinehere startlinehere i went out at the eastern gate i never thought to return endlinehere startlinehere but i came back to the gate with my heart full of sorrow endlinehere startlinehere there was not a peck of rice in the bin there was not a coat hanging on the pegs endlinehere startlinehere so i took my sword and went towards the gate endlinehere startlinehere my wife and child clutched at my coat and wept some people want to be rich and grand i only want to share my porridge with you endlinehere startlinehere above we have the blue waves of the sky below the yellow face of this little child endlinehere startlinehere dear wife i cannot stay endlinehere startlinehere soon it will be too late endlinehere startlinehere when one is growing old one cannot put things off endlinehere startlinehere she went up the mountain to pluck wild herbs she came down the mountain and met her former husband endlinehere startlinehere she knelt down and asked her former husband what do you find your new wife like endlinehere startlinehere my new wife although her talk is clever cannot charm me as my old wife could endlinehere startlinehere in beauty of face there is not much to choose endlinehere startlinehere but in usefulness they are not at all alike endlinehere startlinehere my new wife comes in from the road to meet me my old wife always came down from her tower endlinehere startlinehere my new wife is clever at embroidering silk my old wife was good at plain sewing endlinehere startlinehere of silk embroidery one can do an inch a day of plain sewing more than five feet endlinehere startlinehere putting her silks by the side of your sewing i see that the new will not compare with the old endlinehere startlinehere my love is living to the south of the great sea endlinehere startlinehere what shall i send to greet him endlinehere startlinehere two pearls and a comb of tortoise shell ill send them to him packed in a box of jade endlinehere startlinehere they tell me he is not true they tell me he dashed my box to the ground dashed it to the ground and burnt it and scattered its ashes to the wind endlinehere startlinehere from this day to the ends of time i must never think of him never again think of him endlinehere startlinehere the cocks are crowing and the dogs are barking my brother and his wife will soon know endlinehere startlinehere the autumn wind is blowing the morning wind is sighing endlinehere startlinehere in a moment the sun will rise in the east and then _it_ too will know endlinehere startlinehere i am a prisoner in the hands of the enemy enduring the shame of captivity endlinehere startlinehere my bones stick out and my strength is gone through not getting enough to eat endlinehere startlinehere my brother is a mandarin and his horses are fed on maize endlinehere startlinehere why cant he spare a little money to send and ransom me endlinehere startlinehere if you were riding in a coach and i were wearing a li and one day we met in the road you would get down and bow endlinehere startlinehere if you were carrying a tng and i were riding on a horse and one day we met in the road i would get down for you endlinehere startlinehere i want to be your friend for ever and ever without break or decay endlinehere startlinehere how swiftly it dries the dew on the garlic leaf the dew that dries so fast to morrow will fall again endlinehere startlinehere but he whom we carry to the grave will never more return endlinehere startlinehere what mans land is the graveyard endlinehere startlinehere it is the crowded home of ghosts wise and foolish shoulder to shoulder endlinehere startlinehere the king of the dead claims them all mans fate knows no tarrying endlinehere startlinehere on and on always on and on away from you parted by a life parting endlinehere startlinehere going from one another ten thousand li each in a different corner of the world endlinehere startlinehere the way between is difficult and long face to face how shall we meet again endlinehere startlinehere since we parted the time is already long daily my clothes hang looser round my waist endlinehere startlinehere floating clouds obscure the white sun the wandering one has quite forgotten home endlinehere startlinehere thinking of you has made me suddenly old the months and years swiftly draw to their close endlinehere startlinehere ill put you out of my mind and forget for ever and try with all my might to eat and thrive endlinehere startlinehere green green the grass by the river bank endlinehere startlinehere thick thick the willow trees in the garden endlinehere startlinehere sad sad the lady in the tower endlinehere startlinehere white white sitting at the casement window endlinehere startlinehere fair fair her red powdered face endlinehere startlinehere small small she puts out her pale hand endlinehere startlinehere once she was a dancing house girl endlinehere startlinehere now she is a wandering mans wife endlinehere startlinehere the wandering man went but did not return endlinehere startlinehere it is hard alone to keep an empty bed endlinehere startlinehere green green the cypress on the mound endlinehere startlinehere firm firm the boulder in the stream endlinehere startlinehere mans life lived within this world is like the sojourning of a hurried traveller endlinehere startlinehere a cup of wine together will make us glad and a little friendship is no little matter endlinehere startlinehere yoking my chariot i urge my stubborn horses endlinehere startlinehere i wander about in the streets of wan and lo endlinehere startlinehere in lo town how fine everything is endlinehere startlinehere the caps and belts go seeking each other out endlinehere startlinehere the great boulevards are intersected by lanes wherein are the town houses of royal dukes endlinehere startlinehere the two palaces stare at each other from afar the twin gates rise a hundred feet endlinehere startlinehere by prolonging the feast let us keep our hearts gay and leave no room for sadness to creep in endlinehere startlinehere of this days glorious feast and revel the pleasure and delight are difficult to describe endlinehere startlinehere plucking the lute they sent forth lingering sounds the new melodies in beauty reached the divine endlinehere startlinehere skilful singers intoned the high words those who knew the tune heard the trueness of their singing endlinehere startlinehere we sat there each with the same desire and like thoughts by each unexpressed man in the world lodging for a single life time passes suddenly like dust borne on the wind endlinehere startlinehere then let us hurry out with high steps and be the first to reach the highways and fords rather than stay at home wretched and poor for long years plunged in sordid grief endlinehere startlinehere in the north west there is a high house its top level with the floating clouds endlinehere startlinehere embroidered curtains thinly screen its windows its storied tower is built on three steps endlinehere startlinehere from above there comes a noise of playing and singing the tune sounding oh endlinehere startlinehere who can it be playing so sad a tune endlinehere startlinehere surely it must be chi liangs wife endlinehere startlinehere the tranquil d follows the winds rising the middle lay lingers indecisive endlinehere startlinehere to each note two or three sobs her high will conquered by overwhelming grief endlinehere startlinehere she does not regret that she is left so sad but minds that so few can understand her song endlinehere startlinehere she wants to become those two wild geese that with beating wings rise high aloft endlinehere startlinehere crossing the river i pluck hibiscus flowers in the orchid swamps are many fragrant herbs endlinehere startlinehere i gather them but who shall i send them to endlinehere startlinehere my love is living in lands far away endlinehere startlinehere i turn and look towards my own country the long road stretches on for ever endlinehere startlinehere the same heart yet a different dwelling always fretting till we are grown old endlinehere startlinehere a bright moon illumines the night prospect the house cricket chirrups on the eastern wall endlinehere startlinehere the handle of the pole star points to the beginning of winter endlinehere startlinehere the host of stars is scattered over the sky endlinehere startlinehere the white dew wets the moor grasses with sudden swiftness the times and seasons change endlinehere startlinehere the autumn cicada sings among the trees the swallows alas whither are they gone endlinehere startlinehere once i had a same house friend he took flight and rose high away endlinehere startlinehere he did not remember how once we went hand in hand but left me like footsteps behind one in the dust endlinehere startlinehere in the south is the winnowing fan and the pole star in the north and a herd boy whose ox has never borne the yoke endlinehere startlinehere a friend who is not firm as a great rock is of no profit and idly bears the name endlinehere startlinehere in the courtyard there grows a strange tree its green leaves ooze with a fragrant moisture endlinehere startlinehere holding the branch i cut a flower from the tree meaning to send it away to the person i love endlinehere startlinehere its sweet smell fills my sleeves and lap endlinehere startlinehere the road is long how shall i get it there endlinehere startlinehere such a thing is not fine enough to send but it may remind him of the time that has past since he left endlinehere startlinehere far away twinkles the herd boy star brightly shines the lady of the han river endlinehere startlinehere slender slender she plies her white fingers endlinehere startlinehere click click go the wheels of her spinning loom endlinehere startlinehere at the end of the day she has not finished her task her bitter tears fall like streaming rain endlinehere startlinehere the han river runs shallow and clear set between them how short a space endlinehere startlinehere but the river water will not let them pass gazing at each other but never able to speak endlinehere startlinehere turning my chariot i yoke my horses and go endlinehere startlinehere on and on down the long roads the autumn winds shake the hundred grasses endlinehere startlinehere on every side how desolate and bare endlinehere startlinehere the things i meet are all new things their strangeness hastens the coming of old age endlinehere startlinehere prosperity and decay each have their season endlinehere startlinehere success is bitter when it is slow in coming endlinehere startlinehere mans life is not metal or stone he cannot far prolong the days of his fate endlinehere startlinehere suddenly he follows in the way of things that change endlinehere startlinehere fame is the only treasure that endures endlinehere startlinehere the eastern castle stands tall and high far and wide stretch the towers that guard it endlinehere startlinehere the whirling wind uprises and shakes the earth the autumn grasses grow thick and green endlinehere startlinehere the four seasons alternate without pause the years end hurries swiftly on endlinehere startlinehere the bird of the morning wind is stricken with sorrow the frail cicada suffers and is hard pressed endlinehere startlinehere free and clear let us loosen the bonds of our hearts endlinehere startlinehere why should we go on always restraining and binding endlinehere startlinehere in yen and chao are many fair ladies beautiful people with faces like jade endlinehere startlinehere their clothes are made all of silk gauze endlinehere startlinehere they stand at the door practising tranquil lays endlinehere startlinehere the echo of their singing how sad it sounds endlinehere startlinehere by the pitch of the song one knows the stops have been tightened endlinehere startlinehere to ease their minds they arrange their shawls and belts lowering their song a little while they pause endlinehere startlinehere i should like to be those two flying swallows who are carrying clay to nest in the eaves of your house endlinehere startlinehere i drive my chariot up to the eastern gate from afar i see the graveyard north of the wall endlinehere startlinehere the white aspens how they murmur murmur pines and cypresses flank the broad paths endlinehere startlinehere beneath lie men who died long ago black black is the long night that holds them endlinehere startlinehere deep down beneath the yellow springs thousands of years they lie without waking endlinehere startlinehere in infinite succession light and darkness shift and years vanish like the morning dew endlinehere startlinehere mans life is like a sojourning his longevity lacks the firmness of stone and metal endlinehere startlinehere for ever it has been that mourners in their turn were mourned saint and sage all alike are trapped endlinehere startlinehere seeking by food to obtain immortality many have been the dupe of strange drugs endlinehere startlinehere better far to drink good wine and clothe our bodies in robes of satin and silk endlinehere startlinehere the dead are gone and with them we cannot converse endlinehere startlinehere the living are here and ought to have our love endlinehere startlinehere leaving the city gate i look ahead and see before me only mounds and tombs endlinehere startlinehere the old graves are ploughed up into fields the pines and cypresses are hewn for timber endlinehere startlinehere in the white aspens sad winds sing their long murmuring kills my heart with grief endlinehere startlinehere i want to go home to ride to my village gate endlinehere startlinehere i want to go back but theres no road back endlinehere startlinehere the years of a lifetime do not reach a hundred endlinehere startlinehere yet they contain a thousand years sorrow endlinehere startlinehere when days are short and the dull nights long why not take a lamp and wander forth endlinehere startlinehere if you want to be happy you must do it now there is no waiting till an after time endlinehere startlinehere the fool whos loath to spend the wealth hes got becomes the laughing stock of after ages endlinehere startlinehere it is true that master wang became immortal but how can _we_ hope to share his lot endlinehere startlinehere cold cold the year draws to its end the crickets and grasshoppers make a doleful chirping endlinehere startlinehere the chill wind increases its violence endlinehere startlinehere my wandering love has no coat to cover him endlinehere startlinehere he gave his embroidered furs to the lady of lo but from me his bedfellow he is quite estranged endlinehere startlinehere sleeping alone in the depth of the long night in a dream i thought i saw the light of his face endlinehere startlinehere my dear one thought of our old joys together he came in his chariot and gave me the front reins endlinehere startlinehere i wanted so to prolong our play and laughter to hold his hand and go back with him in his coach endlinehere startlinehere but when he had come he would not stay long nor stop to go with me to the inner chamber endlinehere startlinehere truly without the falcons wings to carry me how can i rival the flying winds swiftness endlinehere startlinehere i go and lean at the gate and think of my grief my falling tears wet the double gates endlinehere startlinehere at the beginning of winter a cold spirit comes the north wind blows chill chill endlinehere startlinehere my sorrows being many i know the length of the nights raising my head i look at the stars in their places endlinehere startlinehere on the fifteenth day the bright moon is full on the twentieth day the toad and hare wane endlinehere startlinehere i put the letter away in the folds of my dress for three years the writing did not fade endlinehere startlinehere how with an undivided heart i loved you i fear that you will never know or guess endlinehere startlinehere the bright moon oh how white it shines shines down on the gauze curtains of my bed endlinehere startlinehere racked by sorrow i toss and cannot sleep endlinehere startlinehere picking up my clothes i wander up and down endlinehere startlinehere my absent love says that he is happy but i would rather he said he was coming back endlinehere startlinehere out in the courtyard i stand hesitating alone endlinehere startlinehere to whom can i tell the sad thoughts i think endlinehere startlinehere staring before me i enter my room again falling tears wet my mantle and robe endlinehere startlinehere autumn wind rises white clouds fly endlinehere startlinehere grass and trees wither geese go south endlinehere startlinehere orchids all in bloom chrysanthemums smell sweet endlinehere startlinehere i think of my lovely lady i never can forget endlinehere startlinehere across the mid stream white waves rise flute and drum keep time to sound of the rowers song amidst revel and feasting sad thoughts come youths years how few endlinehere startlinehere the sound of her silk skirt has stopped endlinehere startlinehere on the marble pavement dust grows endlinehere startlinehere her empty room is cold and still endlinehere startlinehere fallen leaves are piled against the doors endlinehere startlinehere longing for that lovely lady how can i bring my aching heart to rest endlinehere startlinehere is it or isnt it endlinehere startlinehere i stand and look endlinehere startlinehere the swish swish of a silk skirt endlinehere startlinehere how slow she comes endlinehere startlinehere our love was pure as the snow on the mountains white as a moon between the clouds theyre telling me your thoughts are double thats why ive come to break it off endlinehere startlinehere to day well drink a cup of wine endlinehere startlinehere to morrow well part beside the canal walking about beside the canal where its branches divide east and west endlinehere startlinehere alas and alas and again alas endlinehere startlinehere so must a girl cry when shes married if she find not a man of single heart who will not leave her till her hair is white endlinehere startlinehere since our hair was plaited and we became man and wife the love between us was never broken by doubt endlinehere startlinehere so let us be merry this night together feasting and playing while the good time lasts endlinehere startlinehere i suddenly remember the distance that i must travel i spring from bed and look out to see the time endlinehere startlinehere the stars and planets are all grown dim in the sky long long is the road i cannot stay endlinehere startlinehere i am going on service away to the battle ground and i do not know when i shall come back endlinehere startlinehere i hold your hand with only a deep sigh afterwards tears in the days when we are parted endlinehere startlinehere with all your might enjoy the spring flowers but do not forget the time of our love and pride endlinehere startlinehere know that if i live i will come back again and if i die we will go on thinking of each other endlinehere startlinehere the good time will never come back again in a moment our parting will be over endlinehere startlinehere anxiously we halt at the road side hesitating we embrace where the fields begin endlinehere startlinehere the clouds above are floating across the sky swiftly swiftly passing or blending together endlinehere startlinehere the waves in the wind lose their fixed place and are rolled away each to a corner of heaven endlinehere startlinehere from now onwards long must be our parting endlinehere startlinehere so let us stop again for a little while endlinehere startlinehere i wish i could ride on the wings of the morning wind and go with you right to your journeys end endlinehere startlinehere i came ten thousand leagues across sandy deserts in the service of my prince to break the hun tribes endlinehere startlinehere my way was blocked and barred my arrows and sword broken endlinehere startlinehere my armies had faded away my reputation had gone endlinehere startlinehere my old mother is long dead endlinehere startlinehere although i want to requite my prince how can i return endlinehere startlinehere my people have married me in a far corner of earth sent me away to a strange land to the king of the wu sun endlinehere startlinehere a tent is my house of felt are my walls raw flesh my food with mares milk to drink endlinehere startlinehere always thinking of my own country my heart sad within endlinehere startlinehere would i were a yellow stork and could fly to my old home endlinehere startlinehere solemn solemn the coachman gets ready to go chiang chiang the harness bells ring endlinehere startlinehere at break of dawn i must start on my long journey at cock crow i must gird on my belt endlinehere startlinehere i turn back and look at the empty room for a moment i almost think i see you there endlinehere startlinehere one parting but ten thousand regrets as i take my seat my heart is unquiet endlinehere startlinehere what shall i do to tell you all my thoughts endlinehere startlinehere how can i let you know of all my love endlinehere startlinehere precious hairpins make the head to shine and bright mirrors can reflect beauty endlinehere startlinehere fragrant herbs banish evil smells and the scholars harp has a clear note endlinehere startlinehere the man in the book of odes who was given a quince wanted to pay it back with diamonds and rubies endlinehere startlinehere when i think of all the things you have done for me how ashamed i am to have done so little for you endlinehere startlinehere although i know that it is a poor return all i can give you is this description of my feelings endlinehere startlinehere my poor body is alas unworthy i was ill when first you brought me home endlinehere startlinehere limp and weary in the house time passed and i got no better endlinehere startlinehere we could hardly ever see each other i could not serve you as i ought endlinehere startlinehere then you received the imperial mandate you were ordered to go far away to the city endlinehere startlinehere long long must be our parting i was not destined to tell you my thoughts endlinehere startlinehere i stood on tiptoe gazing into the distance interminably gazing at the road that had taken you endlinehere startlinehere with thoughts of you my mind is obsessed in my dreams i see the light of your face endlinehere startlinehere now you are started on your long journey each day brings you further from me endlinehere startlinehere oh that i had a birds wings and high flying could follow you endlinehere startlinehere long i sob and long i cry the tears fall down and wet my skirt endlinehere startlinehere on the eastern way at the city of lo yang at the edge of the road peach trees and plum trees grow on the two sides flower matched by flower across the road leaf touching leaf endlinehere startlinehere a spring wind rises from the north east flowers and leaves gently nod and sway endlinehere startlinehere up the road somebodys daughter comes carrying a basket to gather silkworms food endlinehere startlinehere _she sees the fruit trees in blossom and forgetting about her silkworms begins to pluck the branches endlinehere startlinehere _ with her slender hand she breaks a branch from the tree the flowers fall tossed and scattered in the wind endlinehere startlinehere lovely lady i never did you harm why should you hate me and do me injury endlinehere startlinehere though in the autumn your leaves patter to the ground when spring comes your gay bloom returns endlinehere startlinehere but in mens lives when their bright youth is spent joy and love never come back again endlinehere startlinehere when i was young throughout the hot season there were no carriages driving about the roads endlinehere startlinehere people shut their doors and lay down in the cool or if they went out it was not to pay calls endlinehere startlinehere nowadays ill bred ignorant fellows when they feel the heat make for a friends house endlinehere startlinehere the unfortunate host when he hears someone coming scowls and frowns but can think of no escape endlinehere startlinehere theres nothing for it but to rise and go to the door and in his comfortable seat he groans and sighs endlinehere startlinehere the conversation does not end quickly prattling and babbling what a lot he says endlinehere startlinehere only when one is almost dead with fatigue he asks at last if one isnt finding him tiring endlinehere startlinehere ones arm is almost in half with continual fanning the sweat is pouring down ones neck in streams endlinehere startlinehere do not say that this is a small matter i consider the practice a blot on our social life endlinehere startlinehere i therefore caution all wise men that august visitors should not be admitted endlinehere startlinehere i look up and see his curtains and bed i look down and examine his table and mat endlinehere startlinehere the things are there just as before endlinehere startlinehere but the man they belonged to is not there endlinehere startlinehere his spirit suddenly has taken flight and left me behind far away endlinehere startlinehere to whom shall i look on whom rely endlinehere startlinehere my tears flow in an endless stream endlinehere startlinehere yu yu cry the wandering deer as they carry fodder to their young in the wood endlinehere startlinehere flap flap fly the birds as they carry their little ones back to the nest endlinehere startlinehere i alone am desolate dreading the days of our long parting my grieving hearts settled pain no one else can understand endlinehere startlinehere there is a saying among people sorrow makes us grow old endlinehere startlinehere alas alas for my white hairs endlinehere startlinehere all too early they have come endlinehere startlinehere long wailing long sighing my thoughts are fixed on my sage parent endlinehere startlinehere they say the good live long then why was he not spared endlinehere startlinehere my charioteer hastens to yoke my carriage for i must go on a journey far away endlinehere startlinehere where are you going on your journey far away endlinehere startlinehere to the land of wu where my enemies are endlinehere startlinehere but i must ride many thousand miles beyond the eastern road that leads to wu endlinehere startlinehere i want to take a skiff and cross these rivers but alas for me where shall i find a boat endlinehere startlinehere to sit idle is not my desire gladly enough would i go to my countrys aid endlinehere startlinehere in the north west there is a floating cloud stretched on high like a chariots canvas awning endlinehere startlinehere alas that i was born in these times to be blown along like a cloud puffed by the wind endlinehere startlinehere it has blown me away far to the south east on and on till i came to wu hui endlinehere startlinehere wu hui is not my country why should i go on staying and staying here endlinehere startlinehere i will give it up and never speak of it again this being abroad and always living in dread endlinehere startlinehere i climb to the ridge of pei mang mountain and look down on the city of lo yang endlinehere startlinehere in lo yang how still it is endlinehere startlinehere palaces and houses all burnt to ashes endlinehere startlinehere walls and fences all broken and gaping thorns and brambles shooting up to the sky endlinehere startlinehere i do not see the old old men i only see the new young men endlinehere startlinehere i turn aside for the straight road is lost the fields are overgrown and will never be ploughed again endlinehere startlinehere i have been away such a long time that i do not know which street is which endlinehere startlinehere how sad and ugly the empty moors are endlinehere startlinehere a thousand miles without the smoke of a chimney endlinehere startlinehere i think of the house i lived in all those years i am heart tied and cannot speak endlinehere startlinehere

athwart the sky the moon sinks low endlinehere startlinehere its at the ferry im plucking lilies endlinehere startlinehere but it might be the yellow river so afraid you seem of the wind and waves so long you tarry at the crossing endlinehere startlinehere the road that i came by mounts eight thousand feet the river that i crossed hangs a hundred fathoms endlinehere startlinehere the brambles so thick that in summer one cannot pass endlinehere startlinehere the snow so high that in winter one cannot climb endlinehere startlinehere with branches that interlace lung valley is dark against cliffs that tower ones voice beats and echoes endlinehere startlinehere i turn my head and it seems only a dream that i ever lived in the streets of hsien yang endlinehere startlinehere the evening river is level and motionless the spring colours just open to their full endlinehere startlinehere suddenly a wave carries the moon away and the tidal water comes with its freight of stars endlinehere startlinehere kao huan that son of a mouse dared to attack king pi endlinehere startlinehere but at the first stroke of sword and bow the aggressors plot recoiled on himself endlinehere startlinehere tchirek river lies under the dark mountains where the sky is like the sides of a tent stretched down over the great steppe endlinehere startlinehere the sky is gray gray and the steppe wide wide over grass that the wind has battered low sheep and oxen roam endlinehere startlinehere business men boast of their skill and cunning but in philosophy they are like little children endlinehere startlinehere bragging to each other of successful depredations they neglect to consider the ultimate fate of the body endlinehere startlinehere tell me now what should a man want but to sit alone sipping his cup of wine endlinehere startlinehere then i could jog through a happy five score years and at the end need no paradise endlinehere startlinehere these days continually fuddled with drink i fail to satisfy the appetites of the soul endlinehere startlinehere but seeing men all behaving like drunkards how can i alone remain sober endlinehere startlinehere his subjects were always original but his poems are seldom worth quoting is a chinese opinion of him endlinehere startlinehere i loved you dearly stone fish lake with your rock island shaped like a swimming fish endlinehere startlinehere on the fishs back is the wine cup hollow and round the fish the flowing waters of the lake endlinehere startlinehere the boys on the shore sent little wooden ships each made to carry a single cup of wine endlinehere startlinehere the island drinkers emptied the liquor boats and set their sails and sent them back for more endlinehere startlinehere on the shores of the lake were jutting slabs of rock and under the rocks there flowed an icy stream endlinehere startlinehere heated with wine to rinse our mouths and hands in those cold waters was a joy beyond compare endlinehere startlinehere of gold and jewels i have not any need for caps and coaches i do not care at all endlinehere startlinehere but i wish i could sit on the rocky banks of the lake for ever and ever staring at the stone fish endlinehere startlinehere above the lake are deep mountain valleys and men dwelling whose hearts are without guile endlinehere startlinehere gay like children they swarm to the tops of the trees and run to the water to catch bream and trout endlinehere startlinehere their pleasures are the same as those of beasts and birds they put no restraint either on body or mind endlinehere startlinehere far i have wandered throughout the nine lands wherever i went such manners had disappeared endlinehere startlinehere i find myself standing and wondering perplexed whether saints and sages have really done us good endlinehere startlinehere the hills and rivers of the lowland country you have made your battle ground endlinehere startlinehere how do you suppose the people who live there will procure firewood and hay endlinehere startlinehere do not let me hear you talking together about titles and promotions for a single generals reputation is made out of ten thousand corpses endlinehere startlinehere families when a child is born want it to be intelligent endlinehere startlinehere i through intelligence having wrecked my whole life only hope the baby will prove ignorant and stupid endlinehere startlinehere then he will crown a tranquil life by becoming a cabinet minister endlinehere startlinehere an old man selling charms in a cranny of the town wall endlinehere startlinehere he writes out spells to bless the silkworms and spells to protect the corn endlinehere startlinehere with the money he gets each day he only buys wine endlinehere startlinehere but he does not worry when his legs get wobbly for he has a boy to lean on endlinehere startlinehere away and away i sail in my light boat my heart leaps with a great gust of joy endlinehere startlinehere through the leafless branches i see the temple in the wood over the dwindling stream the stone bridge towers endlinehere startlinehere down the grassy lanes sheep and oxen pass in the misty village cranes and magpies cry endlinehere startlinehere back in my home i drink a cup of wine and need not fear the greed of the evening wind endlinehere startlinehere in the southern village the boy who minds the ox with his naked feet stands on the oxs back endlinehere startlinehere through the hole in his coat the river wind blows through his broken hat the mountain rain pours endlinehere startlinehere on the long dyke he seemed to be far away in the narrow lane suddenly we were face to face endlinehere startlinehere the boy is home and the ox is back in its stall and a dark smoke oozes through the thatched roof endlinehere startlinehere of spring water thirty or forty miles in the evening sunlight three or four houses endlinehere startlinehere youths and boys minding geese and ducks women and girls tending mulberries and hemp endlinehere startlinehere the place remote their coats and scarves old the year fruitful their talk and laughter gay endlinehere startlinehere the old wanderer moors his flat boat and staggers up the bank to pluck wistaria flowers endlinehere startlinehere the little cart jolting and banging through the yellow haze of dusk endlinehere startlinehere the man pushing behind the woman pulling in front endlinehere startlinehere they have left the city and do not know where to go endlinehere startlinehere green green those elm tree leaves _they_ will cure my hunger if only we could find some quiet place and sup on them together endlinehere startlinehere the wind has flattened the yellow mother wort above it in the distance they see the walls of a house endlinehere startlinehere _there_ surely must be people living wholl give you something to eat endlinehere startlinehere they tap at the door but no one comes they look in but the kitchen is empty endlinehere startlinehere they stand hesitating in the lonely road and their tears fall like rain endlinehere startlinehere since i left my home to seek official state seven years i have lived in chang an endlinehere startlinehere what have i gained endlinehere startlinehere we have roamed on horseback under the flowering trees we have walked in the snow and warmed our hearts with wine endlinehere startlinehere we have met and parted at the western gate and neither of us bothered to put on cap or belt endlinehere startlinehere we did not go up together for examination we were not serving in the same department of state endlinehere startlinehere the bond that joined us lay deeper than outward things the rivers of our souls spring from the same well endlinehere startlinehere i look down on the twelve city streets red dust flanked by green trees endlinehere startlinehere coaches and horsemen alone fill my eyes i do not see whom my heart longs to see endlinehere startlinehere of all that walk on the north south road there is not one that i care for more than the rest endlinehere startlinehere at the palace doors the smell of meat and wine on the road the bones of one who was frozen to death endlinehere startlinehere ten leagues riding always facing to the north the cold wind almost blew off my ears endlinehere startlinehere i waited for the bell outside the five gates i waited for the summons within the triple hall endlinehere startlinehere my hair and beard were frozen and covered with icicles my coat and robe chilly like water endlinehere startlinehere at the western window i paused from writing rescripts the pines and bamboos were all buried in stillness endlinehere startlinehere the moon rose and a calm wind came suddenly it was like an evening in the hills endlinehere startlinehere and so as i dozed i dreamed of the south west and thought i was staying at the hsien yu temple endlinehere startlinehere when i woke and heard the dripping of the palace clock i still thought it the murmur of a mountain stream endlinehere startlinehere the snow has gone from chung nan spring is almost come endlinehere startlinehere lovely in the distance its blue colours against the brown of the streets endlinehere startlinehere a thousand coaches ten thousand horsemen pass down the nine roads turns his head and looks at the mountains not one man endlinehere startlinehere we talked together in the yung shou temple we parted to the north of the hsin chang dyke endlinehere startlinehere going home i shed a few tears grieving about things not sorry for you endlinehere startlinehere long long the road to lan tien you said yourself you would not be able to write endlinehere startlinehere reckoning up your halts for eating and sleeping by this time youve crossed the shang mountains endlinehere startlinehere last night the clouds scattered away a thousand leagues the same moonlight scene endlinehere startlinehere when dawn came i dreamt i saw your face it must have been that you were thinking of me endlinehere startlinehere in my dream i thought i held your hand and asked you to tell me what your thoughts were endlinehere startlinehere and _you_ said i miss you bitterly but theres no one here to send to you with a letter endlinehere startlinehere when i awoke before i had time to speak a knocking on the door sounded doong doong endlinehere startlinehere they came and told me a messenger from shang chou had brought a letter a single scroll from you endlinehere startlinehere up from my pillow i suddenly sprang out of bed and threw you my clothes all topsy turvy endlinehere startlinehere i undid the knot and saw the letter within a single sheet with thirteen lines of writing endlinehere startlinehere at the top it told the sorrows of an exiles heart at the bottom it described the pains of separation endlinehere startlinehere the sorrows and pains took up so much space there was no room left to talk about the weather endlinehere startlinehere but you said that when you wrote you were staying for the night to the east of shang chou sitting alone lighted by a solitary candle lodging in the mountain hostel of yang chng endlinehere startlinehere night was late when you finished writing the mountain moon was slanting towards the west endlinehere startlinehere what is it lies aslant across the moon endlinehere startlinehere a single tree of purple _paulovnia_ flowers paulovnia flowers just on the point of falling are a symbol to express thinking of an absent friend endlinehere startlinehere lovingly you wrote on the back side to send in the letter your poem of the paulovnia flower endlinehere startlinehere the poem of the paulovnia flower has eight rhymes yet these eight couplets have cast a spell on my heart endlinehere startlinehere they have taken hold of this mornings thoughts and carried them to yours the night you wrote your letter endlinehere startlinehere the whole poem i read three times each verse ten times i recite endlinehere startlinehere so precious to me are the fourscore words that each letter changes into a bar of gold endlinehere startlinehere when the yellow birds note was almost stopped and half formed the green plums fruit sitting and grieving that spring things were over i rose and entered the eastern gardens gate endlinehere startlinehere i carried my cup and was dully drinking alone suddenly i heard a knocking sound at the door endlinehere startlinehere dwelling secluded i was glad that someone had come how much the more when i saw it was chn hsiung endlinehere startlinehere at ease and leisure all day we talked crowding and jostling the feelings of many years endlinehere startlinehere how great a thing is a single cup of wine endlinehere startlinehere for it makes us tell the story of our whole lives endlinehere startlinehere when i was almost forty i had a daughter whose name was golden bells endlinehere startlinehere now it is just a year since she was born she is learning to sit and cannot yet talk endlinehere startlinehere ashamed to find that i have not a sages heart i cannot resist vulgar thoughts and feelings endlinehere startlinehere henceforward i am tied to things outside myself my only reward the pleasure i am getting now endlinehere startlinehere if i am spared the grief of her dying young then i shall have the trouble of getting her married endlinehere startlinehere my plan for retiring and going back to the hills must now be postponed for fifteen years endlinehere startlinehere ruined and ill a man of two score pretty and guileless a girl of three endlinehere startlinehere not a boy but still better than nothing to soothe ones feeling from time to time a kiss endlinehere startlinehere there came a day they suddenly took her from me her souls shadow wandered i know not where endlinehere startlinehere at last by thinking of the time before she was born by thought and reason i drove the pain away endlinehere startlinehere since my heart forgot her many days have passed and three times winter has changed to spring endlinehere startlinehere this morning for a little the old grief came back because in the road i met her foster nurse endlinehere startlinehere sad sad lean with long illness monotonous monotonous days and nights pass endlinehere startlinehere the summer trees have clad themselves in shade the autumn lan already houses the dew endlinehere startlinehere the eggs that lay in the nest when i took to bed have changed into little birds and flown away endlinehere startlinehere the worm that then lay hidden in its hole has hatched into a cricket sitting on the tree endlinehere startlinehere the four seasons go on for ever and ever in all nature nothing stops to rest even for a moment endlinehere startlinehere only the sick mans heart deep down still aches as of old endlinehere startlinehere deep the waters of the black pool coloured like ink they say a holy dragon lives there whom men have never seen endlinehere startlinehere beside the pool they have built a shrine the authorities have established a ritual a dragon by itself remains a dragon but men can make it a god endlinehere startlinehere prosperity and disaster rain and drought plagues and pestilences by the village people were all regarded as the sacred dragons doing endlinehere startlinehere they all made offerings of sucking pig and poured libations of wine the morning prayers and evening gifts depended on a mediums advice when the dragon comes ah endlinehere startlinehere the wind stirs and sighs paper money thrown ah endlinehere startlinehere silk umbrellas waved endlinehere startlinehere when the dragon goes ah endlinehere startlinehere the wind also still endlinehere startlinehere the cups and vessels are cold endlinehere startlinehere meats lie stacked on the rocks of the pools shore wine flows on the grass in front of the shrine endlinehere startlinehere i do not know of all those offerings how much the dragon eats but the mice of the woods and the foxes of the hills are continually drunk and sated endlinehere startlinehere why are the foxes so lucky endlinehere startlinehere what have the sucking pigs done that year by year _they_ should be killed merely to glut the foxes endlinehere startlinehere that the foxes are robbing the sacred dragon and eating his sucking pig beneath the nine fold depths of his pool does he know or not endlinehere startlinehere there came an officer knocking by night at my door in a loud voice demanding grain tribute endlinehere startlinehere my house servants dared not wait till the morning but brought candles and set them on the barn floor endlinehere startlinehere passed through the sieve clean washed as pearls a whole cart load thirty bushels of grain endlinehere startlinehere but still they cry that it is not paid in full with whips and curses they goad my servants and boys endlinehere startlinehere once in error i entered public life i am inwardly ashamed that my talents were not sufficient endlinehere startlinehere in succession i occupied four official posts for doing nothing ten years salary endlinehere startlinehere often have i heard that saying of ancient men that good and ill follow in an endless chain endlinehere startlinehere and to day it ought to set my heart at rest to return to others the corn in my great barn endlinehere startlinehere in the land of tao chou many of the people are dwarfs the tallest of them never grow to more than three feet endlinehere startlinehere they were sold in the market as dwarf slaves and yearly sent to court described as an offering of natural products from the land of tao chou endlinehere startlinehere a strange offering of natural products i never heard of one yet that parted men from those they loved never to meet again endlinehere startlinehere old men weeping for their grandsons mothers for their children endlinehere startlinehere one day yang chng came to govern the land he refused to send up dwarf slaves in spite of incessant mandates endlinehere startlinehere the emperors heart was deeply moved and he sealed and sent a scroll the yearly tribute of dwarfish slaves is henceforth annulled endlinehere startlinehere the people of tao chou old ones and young ones how great their joy endlinehere startlinehere father with son and brother with brother henceforward kept together from that day for ever more they lived as free men endlinehere startlinehere the people of tao chou still enjoy this gift endlinehere startlinehere and even now when they speak of the governor tears start to their eyes endlinehere startlinehere and lest their children and their childrens children should forget the governors name when boys are born the syllable yang is often used in their forename endlinehere startlinehere of cord and cassia wood is the harp compounded within it lie ancient melodies endlinehere startlinehere ancient melodies weak and savourless not appealing to present mens taste endlinehere startlinehere light and colour are faded from the jade stops dust has covered the rose red strings endlinehere startlinehere decay and ruin came to it long ago but the sound that is left is still cold and clear endlinehere startlinehere i do not refuse to play it if you want me to but even if i play people will not listen endlinehere startlinehere how did it come to be neglected so endlinehere startlinehere because of the chiang flute and the chin flageolet endlinehere startlinehere the singers have hushed their notes of clear song the red sleeves of the dancers are motionless endlinehere startlinehere hugging his lute the old harper of chao rocks and sways as he touches the five chords endlinehere startlinehere the loud notes swell and scatter abroad sa sa like wind blowing the rain endlinehere startlinehere the soft notes dying almost to nothing chieh chieh like the voice of ghosts talking endlinehere startlinehere now as glad as the magpies lucky song again bitter as the gibbons ominous cry endlinehere startlinehere and those who sit and listen to the tune he plays of soul and body lose the mastery endlinehere startlinehere and those who pass that way as he plays the tune suddenly stop and cannot raise their feet endlinehere startlinehere alas alas that the ears of common men should love the modern and not love the old endlinehere startlinehere thus it is that the harp in the green window day by day is covered deeper with dust endlinehere startlinehere in the royal city spring is almost over tinkle tinkle the coaches and horsemen pass endlinehere startlinehere we tell each other this is the peony season and follow with the crowd that goes to the flower market endlinehere startlinehere cheap and dear no uniform price the cost of the plant depends on the number of blossoms endlinehere startlinehere for the fine flower a hundred pieces of damask for the cheap flower five bits of silk endlinehere startlinehere above is spread an awning to protect them around is woven a wattle fence to screen them endlinehere startlinehere if you sprinkle water and cover the roots with mud when they are transplanted they will not lose their beauty endlinehere startlinehere each household thoughtlessly follows the custom man by man no one realizing endlinehere startlinehere there happened to be an old farm labourer who came by chance that way endlinehere startlinehere he bowed his head and sighed a deep sigh but this sigh nobody understood endlinehere startlinehere he was thinking a cluster of deep red flowers would pay the taxes of ten poor houses endlinehere startlinehere tartars led in chains tartars led in chains endlinehere startlinehere their ears pierced their faces bruised they are driven into the land of chin endlinehere startlinehere the son of heaven took pity on them and would not have them slain endlinehere startlinehere a petty officer in a yellow coat took down their names and surnames they were led from the city of chang an under escort of an armed guard endlinehere startlinehere their bodies were covered with the wounds of arrows their bones stood out from their cheeks endlinehere startlinehere they had grown so weak they could only march a single stage a day endlinehere startlinehere in the morning they must satisfy hunger and thirst with neither plate nor cup at night they must lie in their dirt and rags on beds that stank with filth endlinehere startlinehere suddenly they came to the yangtze river and remembered the waters of chiao endlinehere startlinehere with lowered hands and levelled voices they sobbed a muffled song endlinehere startlinehere then one tartar lifted up his voice and spoke to the other tartars _your_ sorrows are none at all compared with _my_ sorrows endlinehere startlinehere those that were with him in the same band asked to hear his tale as he tried to speak the words were choked by anger endlinehere startlinehere he told them i was born and bred in the town of liang yan endlinehere startlinehere in the frontier wars of ta li i fell into the tartars hands endlinehere startlinehere since the days the tartars took me alive forty years have passed they put me into a coat of skins tied with a belt of rope endlinehere startlinehere only on the first of the first month might i wear my chinese dress endlinehere startlinehere as i put on my coat and arranged my cap how fast the tears flowed endlinehere startlinehere i made in my heart a secret vow i would find a way home i hid my plan from my tartar wife and the children she had borne me in the land endlinehere startlinehere i thought to myself it is well for me that my limbs are still strong and yet being old in my heart i feared i should never live to return endlinehere startlinehere the tartar chieftains shoot so well that the birds are afraid to fly from the risk of their arrows i escaped alive and fled swiftly home endlinehere startlinehere hiding all day and walking all night i crossed the great desert where clouds are dark and the moon black and the sands eddy in the wind endlinehere startlinehere but the moving horsemen did not hear that i spoke the han tongue their captain took me for a tartar born and had me bound in chains endlinehere startlinehere they are sending me away to the south east to a low and swampy land no one now will take pity on me resistance is all in vain endlinehere startlinehere thinking of this my voice chokes and i ask of heaven above was i spared from death only to spend the rest of my years in sorrow endlinehere startlinehere my native village of liang yan i shall not see again my wife and children in the tartars land i have fruitlessly deserted endlinehere startlinehere when i fell among tartars and was taken prisoner i pined for the land of han now that i am back in the land of han they have turned me into a tartar endlinehere startlinehere had i but known what my fate would be i would not have started home endlinehere startlinehere for the two lands so wide apart are alike in the sorrow they bring endlinehere startlinehere tartar prisoners in chains endlinehere startlinehere of all the sorrows of all the prisoners mine is the hardest to bear endlinehere startlinehere never in the world has so great a wrong befallen the lot of man a han heart and a han tongue set in the body of a turk endlinehere startlinehere a government bull yoked to a government cart endlinehere startlinehere moored by the bank of chan river a barge loaded with gravel endlinehere startlinehere a single load of gravel how many pounds it weighs endlinehere startlinehere carrying at dawn carrying at dusk what is it all for endlinehere startlinehere they are carrying it towards the five gates to the west of the main road endlinehere startlinehere under the shadow of green laurels they are making a gravel drive endlinehere startlinehere for yesterday arrove newly appointed the assistant chancellor of the realm and was terribly afraid that the wet and mud would dirty his horses hoofs endlinehere startlinehere the chancellors horses hoofs stepped on the gravel and remained perfectly clean but the bull employed in dragging the cart was almost sweating blood endlinehere startlinehere the assistant chancellors business is to save men govern the country and harmonize yin and yang endlinehere startlinehere whether the bulls neck is sore need not trouble him at all endlinehere startlinehere there was once a man who dreamt he went to heaven his dream body soared aloft through space endlinehere startlinehere he rode on the back of a white plumed crane and was led on his flight by two crimson banners endlinehere startlinehere whirring of wings and flapping of coat tails endlinehere startlinehere jade bells suddenly all a tinkle endlinehere startlinehere half way to heaven he looked down beneath him down on the dark turmoil of the world endlinehere startlinehere gradually he lost the place of his native town mountains and water nothing else distinct endlinehere startlinehere the eastern ocean a single strip of white the hills of china five specks of green endlinehere startlinehere gliding past him a host of fairies swept in long procession to the palace of the jade city endlinehere startlinehere they take him to the presence of the mighty jade emperor he bows his head and proffers loyal homage endlinehere startlinehere the emperor says we see you have fairy talents be of good heart and do not slight yourself endlinehere startlinehere we shall send to fetch you in fifteen years and give you a place in the courtyard of immortality endlinehere startlinehere twice bowing he acknowledged the gracious words then woke from sleep full of wonder and joy endlinehere startlinehere he hid his secret and dared not tell it abroad but vowed a vow he would live in a cave of rock endlinehere startlinehere from love and affection he severed kith and kin from his eating and drinking he omitted savoury and spice endlinehere startlinehere his morning meal was a dish of coral dust at night he sipped an essence of dewy mists endlinehere startlinehere in the empty mountains he lived for thirty years daily watching for the heavenly coach to come endlinehere startlinehere the time of appointment was already long past but of wings and coach bells still no sound endlinehere startlinehere his teeth and hair daily withered and decayed his ears and eyes gradually lost their keenness endlinehere startlinehere one morning he suffered the common change and his body was one with the dust and dirt of the hill endlinehere startlinehere gods and fairies endlinehere startlinehere if indeed such things there be their ways are beyond the striving of mortal men endlinehere startlinehere though you sweat and toil what shall your trouble bring endlinehere startlinehere you will only shorten the five score years of your span endlinehere startlinehere sad alas the man who dreamt of fairies endlinehere startlinehere for a single dream spoiled his whole life endlinehere startlinehere boundless the great sea endlinehere startlinehere straight down no bottom sideways no border endlinehere startlinehere of cloudy waves and misty billows down in the uttermost depths men have fabled in the midst there stand three sacred hills endlinehere startlinehere on the hills thick growing herbs that banish death endlinehere startlinehere wings grow on those who eat them and they turn into heavenly hsien endlinehere startlinehere the lord of chin and wu of han believed in these stories and magic workers year by year were sent to gather the herbs endlinehere startlinehere the blessed islands now and of old what but an empty tale endlinehere startlinehere the misty waters spread before them and they knew not where to seek endlinehere startlinehere dauntless the mighty wind endlinehere startlinehere their eyes search but cannot see the shores of the blessed islands endlinehere startlinehere they cannot find the blessed isles and yet they dare not return youths and maidens that began the quest grew grey on board the boat endlinehere startlinehere do you not see the graves on the top of black horse hill and the tombs at mo ling endlinehere startlinehere what is left but the sighing wind blowing in the tangled grasses endlinehere startlinehere the two red towers north and south rise facing each other endlinehere startlinehere i beg to ask to whom do they belong endlinehere startlinehere the two princes blew on their flutes and drew down fairies from the sky who carried them off through the five clouds soaring away to heaven endlinehere startlinehere their halls and houses that they could not take with them were turned into temples planted in the dust of the world endlinehere startlinehere in the tiring rooms and dancers towers all is silent and still only the willows like dancers arms and the pond like a mirror endlinehere startlinehere when the flowers are falling at yellow twilight when things are sad and hushed one does not hear songs and flutes but only chimes and bells endlinehere startlinehere the imperial patent on the temple doors is written in letters of gold for nuns quarters and monks cells ample space is allowed endlinehere startlinehere for green moss and bright moonlight plenty of room provided in a hovel opposite is a sick man who has hardly room to lie down endlinehere startlinehere i remember once when at ping yang they were building a great mans house how it swallowed up the housing space of thousands of ordinary men endlinehere startlinehere the immortals are leaving us two by two and their houses are turned into temples i begin to fear that the whole world will become a vast convent endlinehere startlinehere an old charcoal seller cutting wood and burning charcoal in the forests of the southern mountain endlinehere startlinehere his face stained with dust and ashes has turned to the colour of smoke endlinehere startlinehere the hair on his temples is streaked with gray his ten fingers are black endlinehere startlinehere the money he gets by selling charcoal how far does it go endlinehere startlinehere it is just enough to clothe his limbs and put food in his mouth endlinehere startlinehere although alas the coat on his back is a coat without lining endlinehere startlinehere he hopes for the coming of cold weather to send up the price of coal endlinehere startlinehere last night outside the city a whole foot of snow at dawn he drives the charcoal wagon along the frozen ruts endlinehere startlinehere oxen weary man hungry the sun already high outside the gate to the south of the market at last they stop in the mud endlinehere startlinehere suddenly a pair of prancing horsemen endlinehere startlinehere who can it be coming endlinehere startlinehere a public official in a yellow coat and a boy in a white shirt endlinehere startlinehere in their hands they hold a written warrant on their tongues the words of an order they turn back the wagon and curse the oxen leading them off to the north endlinehere startlinehere a whole wagon of charcoal more than a thousand pieces endlinehere startlinehere if officials choose to take it away the woodman may not complain endlinehere startlinehere half a piece of red silk and a single yard of damask the courtiers have tied to the oxens collar as the price of a wagon of coal endlinehere startlinehere i was going to the city to sell the herbs i had plucked on the way i rested by some trees at the blue gate endlinehere startlinehere along the road there came a horseman riding whose face was pale with a strange look of dread endlinehere startlinehere friends and relations waiting to say good bye pressed at his side but he did not dare to pause endlinehere startlinehere i in wonder asked the people about me who he was and what had happened to him endlinehere startlinehere they told me this was a privy councillor whose grave duties were like the pivot of state endlinehere startlinehere his food allowance was ten thousand cash three times a day the emperor came to his house endlinehere startlinehere yesterday he was called to a meeting of heroes to day he is banished to the country of yai chou endlinehere startlinehere so always the counsellors of kings favour and ruin changed between dawn and dusk endlinehere startlinehere green green the grass of the eastern suburb and amid the grass a road that leads to the hills endlinehere startlinehere resting in peace among the white clouds at last he has made a coup that cannot fail endlinehere startlinehere at hsin fng an old man four score and eight the hair on his head and the hair of his eyebrows white as the new snow endlinehere startlinehere leaning on the shoulders of his great grandchildren he walks in front of the inn with his left arm he leans on their shoulders his right arm is broken endlinehere startlinehere i asked the old man how many years had passed since he broke his arm i also asked the cause of the injury how and why it happened endlinehere startlinehere the old man said he was born and reared in the district of hsin fng at the time of his birth a wise reign no wars or discords endlinehere startlinehere often i listened in the pear tree garden to the sound of flute and song naught i knew of banner and lance nothing of arrow or bow endlinehere startlinehere then came the wars of tien pao and the great levy of men of three men in each house one man was taken endlinehere startlinehere and those to whom the lot fell where were they taken to endlinehere startlinehere when the great army waded across the water seethed like a cauldron when barely ten had entered the water two or three were dead endlinehere startlinehere to the north of my village to the south of my village the sound of weeping and wailing endlinehere startlinehere children parting from fathers and mothers husbands parting from wives endlinehere startlinehere everyone says that in expeditions against the min tribes of a million men who are sent out not one returns endlinehere startlinehere i that am old was then twenty four my name and fore name were written down in the rolls of the board of war endlinehere startlinehere in the depth of the night not daring to let any one know i secretly took a huge stone and dashed it against my arm endlinehere startlinehere bones broken and sinews wounded could not fail to hurt i was ready enough to bear pain if only i got back home endlinehere startlinehere my arm broken ever since it was sixty years ago endlinehere startlinehere one limb although destroyed whole body safe endlinehere startlinehere but even now on winter nights when the wind and rain blow from evening on till days dawn i cannot sleep for pain endlinehere startlinehere not sleeping for pain is a small thing to bear compared with the joy of being alive when all the rest are dead endlinehere startlinehere for otherwise years ago at the ford of lu river my body would have died and my soul hovered by the bones that no one gathered endlinehere startlinehere over the graves of ten thousand soldiers mournfully hovering endlinehere startlinehere so the old man spoke endlinehere startlinehere and i bid you listen to his words have you not heard that the prime minister of kai yan sung kai fu did not reward frontier exploits lest a spirit of aggression should prevail endlinehere startlinehere and have you not heard that the prime minister of tien pao yang kuo chung desiring to win imperial favour started a frontier war endlinehere startlinehere but long before he could win the war people had lost their temper ask the man with the broken arm in the village of hsin fng endlinehere startlinehere white billows and huge waves block the river crossing wherever i go danger and difficulty whatever i do failure endlinehere startlinehere just as in my worldly career i wander and lose the road so when i come to the river crossing i am stopped by contrary winds endlinehere startlinehere of fishes and prawns sodden in the rain the smell fills my nostrils with the stings of insects that come with the fog my whole body is sore endlinehere startlinehere i am growing old time flies and my short span runs out endlinehere startlinehere while i sit in a boat at chiu kou wasting ten days endlinehere startlinehere i take your poems in my hand and read them beside the candle the poems are finished the candle is low dawn not yet come endlinehere startlinehere with sore eyes by the guttering candle still i sit in the dark listening to waves that driven by the wind strike the prow of the ship endlinehere startlinehere i have still to travel in my solitary boat three or four leagues by misty waters and rainy sands while the yellow dusk thickens endlinehere startlinehere the forest trees are leafless and withered after the mountain rain the roofs of the houses are hidden low among the river mists endlinehere startlinehere the horses fed on water grass are too weak to carry their load the cottage walls of wattle and thatch let the wind blow on ones bed endlinehere startlinehere in the distance i see red wheeled coaches driving from the town gate they have taken the trouble these civil people to meet their new prefect endlinehere startlinehere there is no one among men that has not a special failing and my failing consists in writing verses endlinehere startlinehere i have broken away from the thousand ties of life but this infirmity still remains behind endlinehere startlinehere and often when i have finished a new poem alone i climb the road to the eastern rock endlinehere startlinehere i lean my body on the banks of white stone i pull down with my hands a green cassia branch endlinehere startlinehere my mad singing startles the valleys and hills the apes and birds all come to peep endlinehere startlinehere fearing to become a laughing stock to the world i choose a place that is unfrequented by men endlinehere startlinehere at nine rivers in the tenth year in winter heavy snow the river water covered with ice and the forests broken with their load endlinehere startlinehere the birds of the air hungry and cold went flying east and west and with them flew a migrant yen loudly clamouring for food endlinehere startlinehere among the snow it pecked for grass and rested on the surface of the ice it tried with its wings to scale the sky but its tired flight was slow endlinehere startlinehere the boys of the river spread a net and caught the bird as it flew they took it in their hands to the city market and sold it there alive endlinehere startlinehere i that was once a man of the north am now an exile here bird and man in their different kind are each strangers in the south endlinehere startlinehere and because the sight of an exiled bird wounded an exiles heart i paid your ransom and set you free and you flew away to the clouds endlinehere startlinehere yen yen flying to the clouds tell me whither shall you go endlinehere startlinehere the official army and the rebel army have grown old in their opposite trenches the soldiers rations have grown so small theyll be glad of even you endlinehere startlinehere the brave boys in their hungry plight will shoot you and eat your flesh they will pluck from your body those long feathers and make them into arrow wings endlinehere startlinehere _you_ so bravely splashing reds and blues endlinehere startlinehere just when _i_ am getting wrinkled and old endlinehere startlinehere why should you waste the moments of inspiration tracing the withered limbs of a sick man endlinehere startlinehere tall tall is the palace of chi lin but my deeds have not been frescoed on its walls endlinehere startlinehere minutely limned on a foot of painting silk what can i do with a portrait such as _that_ endlinehere startlinehere yesterday i heard that such a one was gone this morning they tell me that so and so is dead endlinehere startlinehere of friends and acquaintances more than two thirds have suffered change and passed to the land of ghosts endlinehere startlinehere those that are gone i shall not see again they alas are for ever finished and done endlinehere startlinehere those that are left where are they now endlinehere startlinehere they are all scattered a thousand miles away endlinehere startlinehere those i have known and loved through all my life on the fingers of my hand how many do i count endlinehere startlinehere longing for each other we are all grown gray through the fleeting world rolled like a wave in the stream endlinehere startlinehere alas that the feasts and frolics of old days have withered and vanished bringing us to this endlinehere startlinehere when shall we meet and drink a cup of wine and laughing gaze into each others eyes endlinehere startlinehere up and up the incense burner peak endlinehere startlinehere in my heart is stored what my eyes and ears perceived endlinehere startlinehere all the year detained by official business to day at last i got a chance to go endlinehere startlinehere grasping the creepers i clung to dangerous rocks my hands and feet weary with groping for hold endlinehere startlinehere there came with me three or four friends but two friends dared not go further endlinehere startlinehere at last we reached the topmost crest of the peak my eyes were blinded my soul rocked and reeled endlinehere startlinehere the chasm beneath me ten thousand feet the ground i stood on only a foot wide endlinehere startlinehere if you have not exhausted the scope of seeing and hearing how can you realize the wideness of the world endlinehere startlinehere the waters of the river looked narrow as a ribbon pn castle smaller than a mans fist endlinehere startlinehere how it clings the dust of the worlds halter endlinehere startlinehere it chokes my limbs i cannot shake it away endlinehere startlinehere thinking of retirement i heaved an envious sigh then with lowered head came back to the ants nest endlinehere startlinehere my new province is a land of bamboo groves their shoots in spring fill the valleys and hills endlinehere startlinehere the mountain woodman cuts an armful of them and brings them down to sell at the early market endlinehere startlinehere things are cheap in proportion as they are common for two farthings i buy a whole bundle endlinehere startlinehere i put the shoots in a great earthen pot and heat them up along with boiling rice endlinehere startlinehere the purple nodules broken like an old brocade the white skin opened like new pearls endlinehere startlinehere now every day i eat them recklessly for a long time i have not touched meat endlinehere startlinehere sent as a present from annam a red cockatoo endlinehere startlinehere coloured like the peach tree blossom speaking with the speech of men endlinehere startlinehere and they did to it what is always done to the learned and eloquent endlinehere startlinehere they took a cage with stout bars and shut it up inside endlinehere startlinehere after lunch one short nap on waking up two cups of tea endlinehere startlinehere raising my head i see the suns light once again slanting to the south west endlinehere startlinehere those who are happy regret the shortness of the day those who are sad tire of the years sloth endlinehere startlinehere but those whose hearts are devoid of joy or sadness just go on living regardless of short or long endlinehere startlinehere above a mountain ten thousand feet high below a river a thousand fathoms deep endlinehere startlinehere a strip of green walled by cliffs of stone wide enough for the passage of a single reed endlinehere startlinehere long before night the walls are black with dusk without wind white waves rise endlinehere startlinehere the big rocks are like a flat sword the little rocks resemble ivory tusks endlinehere startlinehere we are stuck fast and cannot move a step endlinehere startlinehere how much the less three hundred miles endlinehere startlinehere frail and slender the twisted bamboo rope weak the dangerous hold of the towers feet endlinehere startlinehere a single slip the whole convoy lost and _my_ life hangs on _this_ thread endlinehere startlinehere i have heard a saying he that has an upright heart shall walk scathless through the lands of man and mo endlinehere startlinehere how can i believe that since the world began in every shipwreck none have drowned but rogues endlinehere startlinehere and how can i born in evil days and fresh from failure ask a kindness of fate endlinehere startlinehere often i fear that these un talented limbs will be laid at last in an un named grave endlinehere startlinehere suddenly suddenly bearing a stricken heart i left the gates with nothing to comfort me endlinehere startlinehere henceforward relegated to deep seclusion in a bottomless gorge flanked by precipitous mountains five months on end the passage of boats is stopped by the piled billows that toss and leap like colts endlinehere startlinehere the inhabitants of pa resemble wild apes fierce and lusty they fill the mountains and prairies endlinehere startlinehere among such as these i cannot hope for friends and am pleased with anyone who is even remotely human endlinehere startlinehere i took money and bought flowering trees and planted them out on the bank to the east of the keep endlinehere startlinehere i simply bought whatever had most blooms not caring whether peach apricot or plum endlinehere startlinehere a hundred fruits all mixed up together a thousand branches flowering in due rotation endlinehere startlinehere each has its season coming early or late but to all alike the fertile soil is kind endlinehere startlinehere the red flowers hang like a heavy mist the white flowers gleam like a fall of snow endlinehere startlinehere the wandering bees cannot bear to leave them the sweet birds also come there to roost endlinehere startlinehere in front there flows an ever running stream beneath there is built a little flat terrace endlinehere startlinehere sometimes i sweep the flagstones of the terrace sometimes in the wind i raise my cup and drink endlinehere startlinehere the flower branches screen my head from the sun the flower buds fall down into my lap endlinehere startlinehere alone drinking alone singing my songs i do not notice that the moon is level with the steps endlinehere startlinehere the people of pa do not care for flowers all the spring no one has come to look endlinehere startlinehere but their governor general alone with his cup of wine sits till evening and will not move from the place endlinehere startlinehere my niece who is six years old is called miss tortoise my daughter of three little summer dress endlinehere startlinehere one is beginning to learn to joke and talk the other can already recite poems and songs endlinehere startlinehere at morning they play clinging about my feet at night they sleep pillowed against my dress endlinehere startlinehere why children did you reach the world so late coming to me just when my years are spent endlinehere startlinehere young things draw our feelings to them old people easily give their hearts endlinehere startlinehere the sweetest vintage at last turns sour the full moon in the end begins to wane endlinehere startlinehere and so with men the bonds of love and affection soon may change to a load of sorrow and care endlinehere startlinehere but all the world is bound by loves ties why did i think that i alone should escape endlinehere startlinehere trees growing right in front of my window the trees are high and the leaves grow thick endlinehere startlinehere the distant mountain view obscured by this dimly shows between endlinehere startlinehere one morning i took knife and axe with my own hand i lopped the branches off endlinehere startlinehere ten thousand leaves fall about my head a thousand hills came before my eyes endlinehere startlinehere suddenly as when clouds or mists break and straight through the blue sky appears again like the face of a friend one has loved seen at last after an age of parting endlinehere startlinehere first there came a gentle wind blowing one by one the birds flew back to the tree endlinehere startlinehere to ease my mind i gazed to the south east as my eyes wandered my thoughts went far away endlinehere startlinehere of men there is none that has not some preference of things there is none but mixes good with ill endlinehere startlinehere it was not that i did not love the tender branches but better still to see the green hills endlinehere startlinehere i have been ill so long that i do not count the days at the southern window evening and again evening endlinehere startlinehere sadly chirping in the grasses under my eaves the winter sparrows morning and evening sing endlinehere startlinehere by an effort i rise and lean heavily on my bed tottering i step towards the door of the courtyard endlinehere startlinehere by chance i meet a friend who is coming to see me just as if i had gone specially to meet him endlinehere startlinehere they took my couch and placed it in the setting sun they spread my rug and i leaned on the balcony pillar endlinehere startlinehere tranquil talk was better than any medicine gradually the feelings came back to my numbed heart endlinehere startlinehere little sleeping and much grieving the traveller rises at midnight and looks back towards home endlinehere startlinehere the sands are bright with moonlight that joins the shores the sail is white with dew that has covered the boat endlinehere startlinehere nearing the sea the river grows broader and broader approaching autumn the nights longer and longer endlinehere startlinehere thirty times we have slept amid mists and waves and still we have not reached hang chow endlinehere startlinehere i grew up at jung yang i was still young when i left endlinehere startlinehere on and on forty years passed till again i stayed for the night at jung yang endlinehere startlinehere when i went away i was only eleven or twelve this year i am turned fifty six endlinehere startlinehere yet thinking back to the times of my childish games whole and undimmed still they rise before me endlinehere startlinehere the old houses have all disappeared down in the village none of my people are left endlinehere startlinehere it is not only that streets and buildings have changed but steep is level and level changed to steep endlinehere startlinehere alone unchanged the waters of chiu and yu passionless flow in their old course endlinehere startlinehere while on the road to his new province hang chow in he sends a silver spoon to his niece a kuei whom he had been obliged to leave behind with her nurse old mrs endlinehere startlinehere little girls ought to be daintily fed mrs endlinehere startlinehere tsao please see to this endlinehere startlinehere thats why ive packed and sent a silver spoon you will think of me and eat up your food nicely endlinehere startlinehere long ago to a white haired gentleman you made the present of a black gauze hat endlinehere startlinehere the gauze hat still sits on my head but you already are gone to the nether springs endlinehere startlinehere the thing is old but still fit to wear the man is gone and will never be seen again endlinehere startlinehere out on the hill the moon is shining to night and the trees on your tomb are swayed by the autumn wind endlinehere startlinehere that so many of the poor should suffer from cold what can we do to prevent endlinehere startlinehere to bring warmth to a single body is not much use endlinehere startlinehere i wish i had a big rug ten thousand feet long which at one time could cover up every inch of the city endlinehere startlinehere our party scattered at yellow dusk and i came home to bed i woke at midnight and went for a walk leaning heavily on a friend endlinehere startlinehere as i lay on my pillow my vinous complexion soothed by sleep grew sober in front of the tower the ocean moon accompanying the tide had risen endlinehere startlinehere the swallows about to return to the beams went back to roost again the candle at my window just going out suddenly revived its light endlinehere startlinehere all the time till dawn came still my thoughts were muddled and in my ears something sounded like the music of flutes and strings endlinehere startlinehere _then_ on the shore building sand pagodas _now_ at court covered with tinkling jade endlinehere startlinehere this and that equally childish games things whose substance passes in a moment of time endlinehere startlinehere while the hands are busy the heart cannot understand when there are no scriptures then doctrine is sound endlinehere startlinehere even should one zealously strive to learn the way that very striving will make ones error more endlinehere startlinehere all the morning i have lain perversely in bed now at dusk i rise with many yawns endlinehere startlinehere my warm stove is quick to get ablaze at the cold mirror i am slow in doing my hair endlinehere startlinehere with melted snow i boil fragrant tea seasoned with curds i cook a milk pudding endlinehere startlinehere at my sloth and greed there is no one but me to laugh my cheerful vigour none but myself knows endlinehere startlinehere the taste of my wine is mild and works no poison the notes of my harp are soft and bring no sadness endlinehere startlinehere to the three joys in the book of mencius i have added the fourth of playing with my baby boy endlinehere startlinehere i break up cypress and make a book box the box well made and the cypress wood tough endlinehere startlinehere in it shall be kept what authors works endlinehere startlinehere the inscription says po lo tien endlinehere startlinehere all my life has been spent in writing books from when i was young till now that i am old endlinehere startlinehere first and last seventy whole volumes big and little three thousand themes endlinehere startlinehere all i can do is to divide them among my daughters to be left by them to give to my grandchildren endlinehere startlinehere between thirty and forty one is distracted by the five lusts between seventy and eighty one is a prey to a hundred diseases endlinehere startlinehere but from fifty to sixty one is free from all ills calm and still the heart enjoys rest endlinehere startlinehere i have put behind me love and greed i have done with profit and fame i am still short of illness and decay and far from decrepit age endlinehere startlinehere strength of limb i still possess to seek the rivers and hills still my heart has spirit enough to listen to flutes and strings endlinehere startlinehere at leisure i open new wine and taste several cups drunken i recall old poems and sing a whole volume endlinehere startlinehere hundreds of houses thousands of houses like a chess board endlinehere startlinehere the twelve streets like a field planted with rows of cabbage endlinehere startlinehere in the distance perceptible dim dim the fire of approaching dawn and a single row of stars lying to the west of the five gates endlinehere startlinehere mounting on high i begin to realize the smallness of mans domain gazing into distance i begin to know the vanity of the carnal world endlinehere startlinehere i turn my head and hurry home back to the court and market a single grain of rice falling into the great barn endlinehere startlinehere two top knots not yet plaited into one endlinehere startlinehere of thirty years just beyond half endlinehere startlinehere you who are really a lady of silks and satins are now become my hill and stream companion endlinehere startlinehere at the spring fountains together we splash and play on the lovely trees together we climb and sport endlinehere startlinehere her cheeks grow rosy as she quickens her sleeve dancing her brows grow sad as she slows her songs tune endlinehere startlinehere dont go singing the song of the willow branches when theres no one here with a heart for you to break endlinehere startlinehere at night you came and took my hand and we wandered together in my dream when i woke in the morning there was no one to stop the tears that fell on my handkerchief endlinehere startlinehere on the banks of the chang my aged body three times has passed through sickness at hsien yang to the grasses on your grave eight times has autumn come endlinehere startlinehere you lie buried beneath the springs and your bones are mingled with the clay endlinehere startlinehere i lodging in the world of men my hair white as snow endlinehere startlinehere a wei and han lang both followed in their turn among the shadows of the terrace of night did you know them or not endlinehere startlinehere at night in my dream i stoutly climbed a mountain endlinehere startlinehere going out alone with my staff of holly wood endlinehere startlinehere a thousand crags a hundred hundred valleys in my dream journey none were unexplored and all the while my feet never grew tired and my step was as strong as in my young days endlinehere startlinehere can it be that when the mind travels backward the body also returns to its old state endlinehere startlinehere and can it be as between body and soul that the body may languish while the soul is still strong endlinehere startlinehere soul and body both are vanities dreaming and waking both alike unreal endlinehere startlinehere in the day my feet are palsied and tottering in the night my steps go striding over the hills endlinehere startlinehere as day and night are divided in equal parts between the two i _get_ as much as i _lose_ endlinehere startlinehere congratulating himself on the comforts of his life after his retirement from office endlinehere startlinehere lined coat warm cap and easy felt slippers in the little tower at the low window sitting over the sunken brazier endlinehere startlinehere body at rest heart at peace no need to rise early endlinehere startlinehere i wonder if the courtiers at the western capital know of these things or not endlinehere startlinehere no new poems his brush will trace even his fame is dead endlinehere startlinehere his old poems are deep in dust at the bottom of boxes and cupboards endlinehere startlinehere once lately when someone was singing suddenly i heard a verse before i had time to catch the words a pain had stabbed my heart endlinehere startlinehere those who speak know nothing those who know are silent endlinehere startlinehere these words as i am told were spoken by lao tz endlinehere startlinehere if we are to believe that lao tz was himself _one who knew_ how comes it that he wrote a book of five thousand words endlinehere startlinehere chuang tz levels all things and reduces them to the same monad endlinehere startlinehere but _i_ say that even in their sameness difference may be found endlinehere startlinehere a traveller came from across the seas telling of strange sights endlinehere startlinehere in a deep fold of the sea hills i saw a terrace and tower endlinehere startlinehere in the midst there stood a fairy temple with one niche empty endlinehere startlinehere they all told me this was waiting for lo tien to come endlinehere startlinehere traveller i have studied the empty gate i am no disciple of fairies the story you have just told is nothing but an idle tale endlinehere startlinehere the hills of ocean shall never be lo tiens home endlinehere startlinehere when i leave the earth it will be to go to the heaven of bliss fulfilled endlinehere startlinehere they have put my bed beside the unpainted screen they have shifted my stove in front of the blue curtain endlinehere startlinehere i listen to my grandchildren reading me a book i watch the servants heating up my soup endlinehere startlinehere with rapid pencil i answer the poems of

regret that you yielded to me so quickly i entertain no base insolent thoughts about you endlinehere startlinehere arrows of cupid work divers effects endlinehere startlinehere some do but scratch us slow and insidious these poison our hearts over years endlinehere startlinehere yet with a head freshly honed and cunningly fledged certain others pierce to the marrow inflame rapidly there our blood endlinehere startlinehere when gods and goddesses in days of heroes made love then lust followed look and desire with no delay was indulged endlinehere startlinehere surely you dont think the goddess of love lost a moment reflecting when in idean grove anchises caught her eye endlinehere startlinehere nor did luna delay about kissing that beautiful dreamer jealous aurora had else hastily wakened the lad endlinehere startlinehere at the loud banquet hero regarded leander then promptly into dark waters he plunged ardently swam toward his love endlinehere startlinehere today a proud rome claims to be queen of the world endlinehere startlinehere we are so pious we lovers endlinehere startlinehere discreetly we worship all powers hoping for favor from each god and each goddess as well endlinehere startlinehere therefore we gladly confess to singling a special immortal and our devotions each day pledging but solely to her endlinehere startlinehere mischievous celebrants we at these mysteries gay and so solemn silence exactly befits rites at which were adepts endlinehere startlinehere sweet opportunity that is her name endlinehere startlinehere you should meet her endlinehere startlinehere often will she turn up ever in a new form endlinehere startlinehere daughter of proteus might well she be whom he sired upon thetis endlinehere startlinehere in metamorphoses theyve many a hero deceived endlinehere startlinehere so now the daughter beguiles the naive and bedazzles the foolish teases you while youre asleep when you awaken shes flown endlinehere startlinehere eagerly yields herself up to the quick to the active man only endlinehere startlinehere he discovers shes tame playful and tender and sweet endlinehere startlinehere once she appeared to me too a dark skinned girl tumbling over her forehead the hair down in waves heavy and dark endlinehere startlinehere round about a delicate neck curled short little ringlets up from the crown of her head crinkled the unbraided hair endlinehere startlinehere when she dashed by me i seized her mistaking her not endlinehere startlinehere lovingly kiss and embrace she returned knowing and teaching me how endlinehere

endlinehere startlinehere happily now on classical soil i feel inspiration endlinehere startlinehere voices from present and past speak here evocatively endlinehere startlinehere heeding ancient advice i leaf through the works of the ancients with an assiduous hand endlinehere startlinehere daily the pleasures renewed endlinehere startlinehere throughout the night in a different way im kept busy by cupid if erudition is halved rapture is doubled that way endlinehere startlinehere do then i not become wise when i trace with my eye her sweet bosoms form and the line of her hips stroke with my hand endlinehere startlinehere i acquire as i reflect and compare my first understanding of marble see with an eye that feels feel with a hand that sees endlinehere startlinehere while my beloved i grant it deprives me of moments of daylight she in the nighttime hours gives compensation in full endlinehere startlinehere and we do more than just kiss we prosecute reasoned discussions should she succumb to sleep that gives me time for my thoughts endlinehere startlinehere in her embrace its by no means unusual ive composed poems and the hexameters beat gently tapped out on her back fingertips counting in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber endlinehere startlinehere air from deep in her breast penetrates mine and there burns endlinehere startlinehere cupid while stirring the flame in our lamp no doubt thinks of those days when for the triumvirs he similar service performed endlinehere startlinehere can you be cruel enough to sadden me thus with reproaches endlinehere startlinehere germans speak i suppose bitterly when theyre in love endlinehere startlinehere bear it i must when the gossips bring forth accusations im guilty or am i not endlinehere startlinehere but alas all of my guilt was with you endlinehere startlinehere clothes that youve given bear witness for envious neighbors that the poor widow no more grieves for her husband alone endlinehere startlinehere did you not thoughtlessly visit me in the disguise of a cleric muffled all up in a cloak hair all rounded behind endlinehere startlinehere who was it chose that gray monk if not you endlinehere startlinehere well then a prelate now is my lover ah who is my prelate but you endlinehere startlinehere never incredible as it may sound in this clerical city has any cleric brought me

men endlinehere startlinehere we who carry your children next to our hearts in these hearts loyalty we bear you too endlinehere startlinehere as for you men when youve poured out your potency in our embraces and your desires dissipate love with them passes away endlinehere startlinehere these things expressed and taking her child from its chair my beloved presses it close to her heart kisses it tears in her eyes endlinehere startlinehere im now so very ashamed of myself for having permitted gossip of neighbors to spoil picture so eloquent endlinehere startlinehere for a short moment a fire may burn darkly while smoke swirls about it endlinehere startlinehere water dashed on the coals suddenly smothers their glow endlinehere startlinehere rapidly then renewed heat overcomes those lowering vapors sends up a flame that anew bright and more powerful gleams endlinehere startlinehere how very happy i am here in rome when i think of the bad days far back there in the north wrapped in a grayish light endlinehere startlinehere over my head there the heavens weighed down so dismal and gloomy colorless formless that world round this exhausted man lay endlinehere startlinehere seeking myself in myself an unsatisfied spirit i brooded spying out pathways dark lost in dreary reflection endlinehere startlinehere phoebus the god evokes forms clear are his colors by day endlinehere startlinehere bright with the stars comes the evening ringing with songs that are tender and the glow of the moon brighter than northern sun endlinehere startlinehere what blessedness mortals may know endlinehere startlinehere am i now dreaming endlinehere startlinehere or welcomes jupiter father as guest me to ambrosial halls endlinehere startlinehere see i lie here extending my arms toward your knees endlinehere startlinehere i am praying hospitalitys god jupiter xenius endlinehere startlinehere hear how i am come to this place i no longer can say i was seized up by hebe endlinehere startlinehere twas she led to this sacred hill endlinehere startlinehere did you command her a hero to seek and deliver before you endlinehere startlinehere may be she erred endlinehere startlinehere let her mistake profit me endlinehere startlinehere does not fortuna your daughter when strewing her glorious presents after the manner of girls yield to each passing whim endlinehere startlinehere you o hospitable god will by no means now banish a stranger from your olympian heights back to the base earth again endlinehere startlinehere forgive me jupiter is not romes capitoline hill second olympus to you endlinehere startlinehere suffer me jupiter here and let hermes guide me at last then past cestius tomb gently to orkus below endlinehere startlinehere when you were small you say neither did others consider you f air nor even your mother find praise and i believe it till you grew bigger developing quietly over the years endlinehere startlinehere i picture you to myself as an unusual child endlinehere startlinehere also the blossoms on grapevines are wanting in shape and in color although the fruit when its ripe pleases both mankind and gods endlinehere startlinehere kindling autumnal fire in a rustic convivial fireplace how the sticks crackle and spew flames and glittering sparks endlinehere startlinehere strikes me especially pleasant this evening endlinehere startlinehere then in the morning officious shell leave the bed of her lover rouse adroitly the flames out from their ashes anew endlinehere startlinehere cupid has lent to her above others the gift of cajoling up from the ashes desire just when slumbers begun endlinehere startlinehere therefore ye living rejoice that love keeps you warm for a while yet until cold lethe anoints captures your foot in its flight endlinehere startlinehere they are for you o ye graces just a few leaves by a poet onto your pure altar laid buds of the rose beside offered in confidence endlinehere startlinehere but its to bacchus the sensuous dreamer cythera sends glances bathed in sweetest desire even in marble theyre damp endlinehere startlinehere thinking about his embrace and its pleasures she seems to be asking shouldnt our glorious son here at our side stand erect endlinehere startlinehere cant you hear voices beloved out on the via flamina endlinehere startlinehere reapers are now going home back from harvesting grain endlinehere startlinehere they had journeyed to rome from afar and here plaited for ceres wreaths which the romans today scorn to make for themselves endlinehere startlinehere festivals no longer celebrate ceres the nourishing goddess who replaced acorns of old giving man golden wheat endlinehere startlinehere let us commemorate her then ourselves in festival private two constitute a whole tribe when they are two in love endlinehere startlinehere have you by any chance heard how that mystical strange celebration followed victorious troops back from eleusis to rome endlinehere startlinehere greeks were the ones who began it and only to greeks they proclaimed it even within roman walls come to the sanctified night endlinehere startlinehere those who were not of the cult kept their distance neophytes trembled waiting in garments of white symbol of all that is pure endlinehere startlinehere then the initiates must aimlessly wander about through the eerie circles of figures as if pilgriming through their own dreams endlinehere startlinehere snakes on the ground were writhing about endlinehere startlinehere surely the gestures of murmuring priests must contain some deep meaning impatient acolytes wait anxiously hoping for light endlinehere startlinehere not until after many a testing and trial did they discover what within sacred ring secretive image concealed endlinehere startlinehere what was this mystery other than this that demeter goddess once upon a time had to a hero been kind endlinehere startlinehere it was to jason powerful king of the cretans she granted of her immortal self hidden sweet parts to explore endlinehere startlinehere that made the fortune of crete endlinehere startlinehere the marital bed of the goddess soon grew pregnant with grain heavy her bounteous fields endlinehere startlinehere as for the rest of the world it languished away while ceres derelict of her true task dalliance offered in love endlinehere startlinehere now the initiate youths having followed this tale all astonished turned and beckoned their loves love do you comprehend endlinehere startlinehere see there the sacred shade beneath that bushy boughed myrtle endlinehere startlinehere our satisfaction will there scarcely endanger a world endlinehere startlinehere cupid is always a scoundrel and if you believe him hell cheat you endlinehere startlinehere heres what the hypocrite said trust me just once more this time endlinehere startlinehere i have the best of intentions toward you who have now dedicated i recognize it with thanks life and writings to me endlinehere startlinehere lo i have followed you hither to rome and id like to do something here in this far away land pleasing to such an old friend endlinehere startlinehere every traveller ive ever known has complained of poor treatment he whom i recommend treatment delicious receives endlinehere startlinehere how youve revered the formative will of those ancient artists endlinehere startlinehere in their own ateliers often i ve visited them endlinehere startlinehere as for their works why i formed those myself now this time im boasting not endlinehere startlinehere oh come now admit what i am saying is true endlinehere startlinehere where are your own creations your service to me having slackened endlinehere startlinehere where is inventions glow now endlinehere startlinehere where is the color all gone endlinehere startlinehere friend do you hope you can create again endlinehere startlinehere the school of the ancients yet remains open endlinehere startlinehere its gates years have not closed them to you endlinehere startlinehere i am eternally young and as teacher i still love the young ones endlinehere startlinehere wisdom that comes with old age pleases me not endlinehere startlinehere listen here wasnt antiquity young when those fortunate ancients were living endlinehere startlinehere happy then be your life too in it antiquity lives endlinehere startlinehere where will you find a fit theme for your song endlinehere startlinehere it is i must provide it endlinehere startlinehere as for a style truly grand love can alone give you that endlinehere startlinehere all of these claims that sophist asserted endlinehere startlinehere could i contradict him endlinehere startlinehere i am wont to obey when my commander decrees endlinehere startlinehere treacherous now he is keeping his word giving me themes for my poems while he is stealing my time potency presence of mind endlinehere startlinehere gazing into her
