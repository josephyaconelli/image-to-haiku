endlinehere  a cold morning goose honks echo off the pavement endlinehere  steamed milk snowmelt running from the coffee shop roof endlinehere  between the yoga and chi gung classes scent of burning sage endlinehere  dawn storm a bit of mountain ash stirred into the snow endlinehere  horizonless sky colored ice turns in the bay endlinehere  sharp air the patch of blue changes shape endlinehere  daylight moon the shadows of bubbles under the ice endlinehere  fog patches a second little face in the sonogram endlinehere  spin cycle snow flakes swirl outside the laundromat endlinehere  lifting fog a few white feathers in the ravens breast endlinehere  subzero the icicles filled with moonlight endlinehere  long cold snap the icicle begins to fork endlinehere  low clouds a gull circles above the police car light endlinehere  snowy banks the drifting duck leans into a curve endlinehere  a long split in the black inky cap snow clouds endlinehere  dusk a yellow leaf passes through the beaver dam endlinehere  seasons end the scent of fish drifts downstream endlinehere  new coolness a cloud passes through the mountain notch endlinehere  soft rain fishing line parts a cloud of gnats endlinehere  evening light following the anchor line into the sea endlinehere  how quickly the nights grow longer fireweed in bloom endlinehere  summer salad a nasturtium burns the tip of my tongue endlinehere  a spider web caught in my hand scent of rain endlinehere  a damp evening each of us with our own cloud of gnats endlinehere  the evening train almost empty sundogs endlinehere  week of rain the henna tatoo fading fast endlinehere  low tide a shorebirds call rises from the mud endlinehere  sunday drive all the rain clouds toward home endlinehere  wildfire haze between the icebergs the blue wind endlinehere  dandelions i lose sight of the yellow butterfly endlinehere  someone whistling blue moon at the falls the mist endlinehere  lenghtening days a birds shadow crosses the yellow wall endlinehere  new moon lamplight fills the holes in a shot out sign endlinehere  moss growing on the manhole cover winter rain endlinehere  news of his death i cant stop looking at the sickle moon endlinehere  daybreak ice between the river stones endlinehere  locking it moonlight at the back of the mailbox endlinehere  silence the evening snow falls onto moss endlinehere  distant thunder a caterpillar drops from a ragged leaf endlinehere  first light the perfect symmetry of a moth endlinehere  noon the morning clouds roll from the valley endlinehere  slowly a loon preens in the mountains reflection endlinehere  waiting dandelion fluff lands on the table endlinehere  a twilight sun between two peaks white lilacs endlinehere  boardwalking the dragonflys shadow drops through a crack endlinehere  in the far shadows something swimming or a log endlinehere  flashing against the winter killed grass a swans whiteness endlinehere  april a gulls cry passing through morning snow endlinehere  spring evening a long pause on the bridge to watch the water run endlinehere  sunny afternoon the scent of leaf mold mixed in the ice endlinehere  water changing into ice the pale moon endlinehere  hazy afternoon the woodpeckers call bounces off the ice endlinehere  dusky clouds a patch of blue hangs over the valley endlinehere  february the heart shaped tracks of a moose endlinehere  returning birds three notes pass through morning fog endlinehere  waiting for the loon to surface i hold my breath endlinehere  somewhere in the autumn haze cranes calling endlinehere  days end muddy boots cold coffee endlinehere  winter fog floating out of the barn a farmers lantern endlinehere  cold morning only the sound of pages turning endlinehere  gray dusk the orange flare of his cigarette endlinehere  ash wednesday in slowly passing clouds a dusting of snow endlinehere  smoke curling from a snuffed candle crescent moon endlinehere  winter morning blast of a train whistle endlinehere  morning commute a hawk perches on a speed limit sign endlinehere  blustery night imperfect lullabies from the windchimes endlinehere  valentines day a forsythia without birds endlinehere  early spring air all day long our beds not made endlinehere  husband away washing his socks by hand endlinehere  between memories and the parents grave the curtain of rain endlinehere  my sweaty skin enough for three weeks his ironed shirts endlinehere  beggars steps at the bakery slower and slower endlinehere  force and yielding meet together an attack is half repulsed endlinehere  shafts of broken sunlight dissolving convolutions of torpid cloud endlinehere  the boat drifts to rest under the outward spraying branches endlinehere  she is an iris dark purple pale rose under the gnarled boughs that shatter their stars of bloom endlinehere  she waves delicately with the movement of the tree endlinehere  of what is she dreaming endlinehere  of long nights lit with orange lanterns of wine cups and compliments and kisses of the two sword men endlinehere  and of dawn when weary sleepers lie outstretched on the mats of the palace and of the iris stalk that is broken in the fountain endlinehere  autumn winds roll through the dry leaves on her garments autumn birds shiver athwart star hung skies endlinehere  under the blossoming plum tree she expresses the pilgrimage of grey souls passing athwart loves scarlet maples to the ash strewn summit of death endlinehere  iris amid clouds must be her name endlinehere  tall and lonely as the mountain iris cold and distant endlinehere  she has never known longing many have died for love of her endlinehere  he listens idly he is content with her voice endlinehere  they are spotted with thunder showers falling upon the crimson petals endlinehere  she is a fierce kitten leaping in sunlight towards the swaying boughs endlinehere  she is a gust of wind bending in parallel curves the boughs of the willow tree endlinehere  gilded hummingbirds are whizzing through the palace garden deceived by the jade petals of the emperors jewel trees endlinehere  the wind half blows her robes that subside listlessly as swaying pines endlinehere  the wind tosses hers in circles that recoil upon themselves how should i love as the swaying or tossing wind endlinehere  she glances expectantly through the pine avenue to the cherry tree summit where her lover will appear endlinehere  gold and vermilion the afternoon endlinehere  i wait here dreaming of vermilion sunsets in my heart is a half fear of the chill autumn rain endlinehere  the daimyo and the courtesan compliment each other endlinehere  he invites her to walk out through the maples she half refuses hiding fear in her heart endlinehere  she is like the great rains that fall over the earth in winter time endlinehere  gaily he offers packets of merchandise endlinehere  he is a harlequin of illusions his nimble features skip into smiles like rainbows cheating the villagers endlinehere  but in his heart all the while is another knowledge the sorrow of the bleakness of the long wet winter night endlinehere  one life is a long summer tall hollyhocks stand proud upon its paths little yellow waves of sunlight bring scarlet butterflies endlinehere  another life is a brief autumn fierce storm rack scrawled with lightning passed over it leaving the naked bleeding earth stabbed with the swords of the rain endlinehere  he plots for he is angry he sneers for he is bold endlinehere  he clinches his fist like a twisted snake coiling itself preparing to raise its head above the long grasses of the plain endlinehere  i have forgotten how many times he kissed me but i cannot forget a swaying branch a leaf that fell to earth endlinehere  he stands irresolute cloaking the light of his lantern endlinehere  tonight he will either find new love or a sword thrust but his soul is troubled with ghosts of old regret endlinehere  like vines with crimson flowers they climb upwards into his heart endlinehere  she was a dream of moons of fluttering handkerchiefs of flying leaves of parasols a riddle made to break my heart the lightest impulse to her was more dear than the deep toned temple bell endlinehere  she fluttered to my sword hilt an instant and then flew away but who will spend all day chasing a butterfly endlinehere  is it a vision under the moonlight endlinehere  no it is only a beautiful geisha swaying down the street endlinehere  out of the rings and the bubbles the curls and the swirls of the water out of the crystalline shower of drops shattered in play her body and her thoughts arose endlinehere  poems are falling from them swift as the wind that shakes the lance like bamboo leaves the stars close around like bubbles stirred by the silver oars of poems passing endlinehere  beware for the dying vine can hold the strongest oak endlinehere  only by cutting at the root can love be altered endlinehere  late in the night a rosy glimmer yet defies the darkness endlinehere  but the evening is growing late the blinds are being lowered she who held your heart and charmed you is only a rosy glimmer of flame remembered endlinehere  rain rattles on the pavement puddles stand in the bluish stones afar in the yoshiwara is she who holds my heart endlinehere  alas the torn lantern of my hope trembles and sputters in the rain endlinehere  i saw him pass at twilight he was a dark cloud travelling over palace roofs with one claw drooping endlinehere  one dainty thrust no more than this he needs endlinehere  his heart is like a wind torn between cloud and butterfly whether he will roll passively to one or chase endlessly the other endlinehere  my heart is broken and mournful as rain heard beating far off in the distance while earth is parched more near endlinehere  he only can bow to men lofty as a god to those beneath him who has taken sins and sorrows and whose deathless spirit leaps beneath them like a golden carp in the torrent endlinehere  but the laughing rains of spring will break the weak green shoots of their love endlinehere  his will grow a towering stalk hers a cowering flower under it endlinehere  would that the rains of all the winters might wash away my grief endlinehere  the cranes have come back to the temple the winds are flapping the flags about through a flute of reeds i will blow a song endlinehere  chrysanthemums bending before the wind endlinehere  chrysanthemums wavering in the black choked grasses endlinehere  the wind frowns at them he tears off a green and orange stalk of broken chrysanthemum endlinehere  the chrysanthemums spread their flattered heads and scurry off before the wind endlinehere  storm birds of autumn with draggled wings sleet beaten wind tattered snow frozen stopping in sheer weariness between the gnarled red pine trees twisted in doubt and despair whence do you come pilgrims over what snow fields endlinehere  to what southern province hidden behind dim peaks would you go endlinehere  too long were the telling wherefore we set out and where we will find rest only the gods may tell endlinehere  only beyond the still grey shoji for the breadth of innumerable countries is the sea with ships asleep in the blue black starless night endlinehere  a squall has struck the sea afar off endlinehere  you can feel it quiver over the paper parasol with which she shields her face in the drawn together skirts of her robes as she turns to meet it endlinehere  windy evening of autumn by the grey green swirling river people are resting like still boats tugging uneasily at their cramped chains endlinehere  some are moving slowly like the easy winds brown blue dull green the villages in the distance sleep on the banks of the river the waters sullenly clash and murmur endlinehere  the chatter of the passersby is dulled beneath the grey unquiet sky endlinehere  the green and violet peacocks through the golden dusk showered upon them from the vine hung lanterns stately nostalgically parade endlinehere  i will scrawl on the walls of the night faces endlinehere  leering sneering scowling threatening faces weeping twisting yelling howling faces faces fixed in a contortion between a scream and a laugh meaningless faces endlinehere  i will cover the walls of night with faces till you do not know if these faces are but masks or you the masks for them endlinehere  faces too grotesque for laughter faces too shattered by pain for tears faces of such ugliness that the ugliness grows beauty endlinehere  they will haunt you morning evening burning burning ever returning endlinehere  their own infamy creating till you strike at life and hate it burn your soul up so in hating endlinehere  i will scrawl on the walls of the night faces pitiless flaring staring endlinehere  the seasons passed for her like pale iris wilting or peonies flying to ribbons before the storm gusts endlinehere  the sombre pine tops waited until the seasons had passed endlinehere  my beloved is like blue smoke that rises in long slow planes and wavers over the dark paths of old gardens long neglected endlinehere  there was a city living here long ago of all that city there is only one stone left half buried in the marsh with characters upon it which no one now can read endlinehere  in my heart is the sorrow of years like red leaves buried in snow endlinehere  girls will laugh and scatter cherry petals sometimes they will rest in the twisted pine trees shade endlinehere  if one presses her warm lips to this tablet the dust of my body will feel a thrill deep down in the silent earth endlinehere  the sky spreads out its poor array of tattered flags saffron and rose over the weary huddle of housetops smoking their evening pipes in silence endlinehere  the city gleams with lights this evening like loud and yawning laughter from red lips endlinehere  as the fish that leaps from the river as the dropping of a november leaf at twilight as the faint flicker of lightning down the southern sky so i saw beauty far away endlinehere  i dreamed i caught your loveliness in little silver jars and when you died i opened them and there was only soot within endlinehere  rain fell so softly in the evening i almost thought it was the trees that were talking endlinehere  cities are the toy boxes time plays with and there are often many doll houses of which the dolls are lost endlinehere  a poets moods fluttering butterflies in the rain endlinehere  grass moves in the wind my soul is backwards blown endlinehere  land green brown sea brown grey island dull peacock blue sky stone grey endlinehere  a bell in the fog creeps out echoing faintly the pale broad flashes of vibrating twilight faded gold endlinehere  there is a goddess who walks shrouded by day at night she throws her blue veil over the earth endlinehere  men only see her naked glory through the little holes in the veil endlinehere  an old courtyard hidden away in the afternoon endlinehere  grey walks mossy stones copper carp swimming lazily and beyond a faint toneless hissing echo of rain that tears at my heart endlinehere  here i am an old man in a dry month being read to by a boy waiting for rain endlinehere  i was neither at the hot gates nor fought in the warm rain nor knee deep in the salt marsh heaving a cutlass bitten by flies fought endlinehere  my house is a decayed house and the jew squats on the window sill the owner spawned in some estaminet of antwerp blistered in brussels patched and peeled in london endlinehere  the goat coughs at night in the field overhead rocks moss stonecrop iron merds endlinehere  the woman keeps the kitchen makes tea sneezes at evening poking the peevish gutter endlinehere  i an old man a dull head among windy spaces endlinehere  signs are taken for wonders endlinehere  we would see a sign the word within a word unable to speak a word swaddled with darkness endlinehere  in the juvescence of the year came christ the tiger in depraved may dogwood and chestnut flowering judas to be eaten to be divided to be drunk among whispers by mr endlinehere  vacant shuttles weave the wind endlinehere  i have no ghosts an old man in a draughty house under a windy knob endlinehere  after such knowledge what forgiveness endlinehere  think now history has many cunning passages contrived corridors and issues deceives with whispering ambitions guides us by vanities endlinehere  think now she gives when our attention is distracted and what she gives gives with such supple confusions that the giving famishes the craving endlinehere  gives too late whats not believed in or if still believed in memory only reconsidered passion endlinehere  gives too soon into weak hands whats thought can be dispensed with till the refusal propagates a fear endlinehere  think neither fear nor courage saves us endlinehere  unnatural vices are fathered by our heroism endlinehere  these tears are shaken from the wrath bearing tree endlinehere  the tiger springs in the new year endlinehere  us he devours endlinehere  think at last we have not reached conclusion when i stiffen in a rented house endlinehere  think at last i have not made this show purposelessly and it is not by any concitation of the backward devils endlinehere  i would meet you upon this honestly endlinehere  i that was near your heart was removed therefrom to lose beauty in terror terror in inquisition endlinehere  i have lost my passion why should i need to keep it since what is kept must be adulterated endlinehere  i have lost my sight smell hearing taste and touch how should i use it for your closer contact endlinehere  these with a thousand small deliberations protract the profit of their chilled delirium excite the membrane

endlinehere  so how should i presume endlinehere  and how should i presume endlinehere  and i have known the arms already known them all arms that are braceleted and white and bare but in the

endlinehere  i do not think that they will sing to me endlinehere  i have seen them riding seaward on the waves combing the white hair of the waves blown back when the wind blows the water white and

let us take the air in a tobacco trance admire the monuments discuss the late events correct our watches by the public clocks endlinehere  then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks endlinehere  ii now that lilacs are in bloom she has a bowl of lilacs in her room and twists one in her fingers while she talks endlinehere  i smile of course and go on drinking tea endlinehere  yet with these april

achilles heel endlinehere  you will go on and when you have prevailed you can say at this point many a one has failed endlinehere  but what have i but what have i my friend to give you what can you receive from me endlinehere  only the friendship and the sympathy of one about to reach her journeys end endlinehere  i shall sit here serving tea to friends endlinehere  i take my hat how can i make a cowardly amends for what she has said to me endlinehere  you will see me any morning in the park reading the comics and the sporting page endlinehere  particularly i remark an english countess goes upon the stage endlinehere  a greek was murdered at a polish dance another bank defaulter has confessed endlinehere  are these ideas right or wrong endlinehere  and so you are going abroad and when do you return endlinehere  but thats a useless question endlinehere  you hardly know when you are coming back you will find so much to learn endlinehere  my smile falls heavily among the bric brac endlinehere  perhaps you can write to me endlinehere  my self possession flares up for a second this is as i had reckoned endlinehere  i have been wondering frequently of late but our beginnings never know our ends endlinehere  why we have not developed into friends endlinehere  i feel like one who smiles and turning shall remark suddenly his expression in a glass endlinehere  my self possession gutters we are really in the dark endlinehere  for everybody said so all our friends they all were sure our feelings would relate so closely endlinehere  i myself can hardly understand endlinehere  we must leave it now to fate endlinehere  you will write at any rate endlinehere  perhaps it is not too late endlinehere  and i must borrow every changing shape to find expression endlinehere  dance dance like a dancing bear cry like a parrot chatter like an ape endlinehere  let us take the air in a tobacco trance well endlinehere  would she not have the advantage after all endlinehere  this music is successful with a dying fall now that we talk of dying and should i have the right to smile endlinehere  i the winter evening settles down with smell of steaks in passageways endlinehere  the burnt out ends of smoky days endlinehere  and then the lighting of the lamps endlinehere  ii the morning comes to consciousness of faint stale smells of beer from the sawdust trampled street with all its muddy feet that press to early coffee stands endlinehere  with the other masquerades that time resumes one thinks of all the hands that are raising dingy shades in a thousand furnished rooms endlinehere  i am moved by fancies that are curled around these images and cling the notion of some infinitely gentle infinitely suffering thing endlinehere  wipe your hand across your mouth and laugh the worlds revolve like ancient women gathering fuel in vacant lots endlinehere  half past one the street lamp sputtered the street lamp muttered the street lamp said regard that woman who hesitates toward you in the light of the door which opens on her like a grin endlinehere  you see the border of her dress is torn and stained with sand and you see the corner of her eye twists like a crooked pin endlinehere  a broken spring in a factory yard rust that clings to the form that the strength has left hard and curled and ready to snap endlinehere  half past two the street lamp said remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter slips out its tongue and devours a morsel of rancid butter endlinehere  so the hand of the child automatic slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay endlinehere  i could see nothing behind that childs eye endlinehere  half past three the lamp sputtered the lamp muttered in the dark endlinehere  she smooths the hair of the grass endlinehere  the moon has lost her memory endlinehere  the reminiscence comes of sunless dry geraniums and dust in crevices smells of chestnuts in the streets and female smells in shuttered rooms and cigarettes in corridors and cocktail smells in bars endlinehere  the lamp said four oclock here is the number on the door endlinehere  you have the key the little lamp spreads a ring on the stair mount endlinehere  the bed is open the tooth brush hangs on the wall put your shoes at the door sleep prepare for life endlinehere  the last twist of the knife endlinehere  they are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens and along the trampled edges of the street i am aware of the damp souls of housemaids sprouting despondently at area gates endlinehere  the readers of the boston evening transcript sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn endlinehere  miss helen slingsby was my maiden aunt and lived in a small house near a fashionable square cared for by servants to the number of four endlinehere  now when she died there was silence in heaven and silence at her end of the street endlinehere  the shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet he was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before endlinehere  the dogs were handsomely provided for but shortly afterwards the parrot died too endlinehere  the dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece and the footman sat upon the dining table holding the second housemaid on his knees who had always been so careful while her mistress lived endlinehere  miss nancy ellicott strode across the hills and broke them rode across the hills and broke them the barren new england hills riding to hounds over the cow pasture endlinehere  miss nancy ellicott smoked and danced all the modern dances and her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it but they knew that it was modern endlinehere  upon the glazen shelves kept watch matthew and waldo guardians of the faith the army of unalterable law endlinehere  apollinax visited the united states his laughter tinkled among the teacups endlinehere  i thought of fragilion that shy figure among the birch trees and of priapus in the shrubbery gaping at the lady in the swing endlinehere  in the palace of mrs endlinehere  phlaccus at professor channing cheetahs he laughed like an irresponsible foetus endlinehere  i looked for the head of mr endlinehere  apollinax rolling under a chair or grinning over a screen with seaweed in its hair endlinehere  i heard the beat of centaurs hoofs over the hard turf as his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon endlinehere  he is a charming man but after all what did he mean endlinehere  he must be unbalanced there was something he said that i might have challenged endlinehere  of dowager mrs endlinehere  phlaccus and professor and mrs endlinehere  cheetah i remember a slice of lemon and a bitten macaroon endlinehere  as she laughed i was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and being part of it until her teeth were only accidental stars with a talent for squad drill endlinehere  i was drawn in by short gasps inhaled at each momentary recovery lost finally in the dark caverns of her throat bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles endlinehere  i decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be stopped some of the fragments of the afternoon might be collected and i concentrated my attention with careful subtlety to this end endlinehere  i observe our sentimental friend the moon endlinehere  or possibly fantastic i confess it may be prester johns balloon or an old battered lantern hung aloft to light poor travellers to their distress endlinehere  she then how you digress endlinehere  and i then some one frames upon the keys that exquisite nocturne with which we explain the night and moonshine music which we seize to body forth our vacuity endlinehere  she then does this refer to me endlinehere  oh no it is i who am inane endlinehere  you madam are the eternal humorist the eternal enemy of the absolute giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist endlinehere  with your air indifferent and imperious at a stroke our mad poetics to confute and are we then so serious endlinehere  o quam te memorem virgo endlinehere  i should find some way incomparably light and deft some way we both should understand simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand endlinehere  she turned away but with the autumn weather compelled my imagination many days many days and many hours her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers endlinehere  and i wonder how they should have been together endlinehere  i should have lost a gesture and a pose endlinehere  sometimes these cogitations still amaze the troubled midnight and the noons repose endlinehere  in winter i get up at night and dress by yellow candle light endlinehere  in summer quite the other way i have to go to bed by day endlinehere  i have to go to bed and see the birds still hopping on the tree or hear the grown up peoples feet still going past me in the street endlinehere  and does it not seem hard to you when all the sky is clear and blue and i should like so much to play to have to go to bed by day endlinehere  all night long and every night when my mamma puts out the light i see the people marching by as plain as day before my eye endlinehere  armies and emperors and kings all carrying different kinds of things and marching in so grand a way you never saw the like by day endlinehere  so fine a show was never seen at the great circus on the green for every kind beast and man is marching in that caravan endlinehere  at first they move a little slow but still the faster on they go and still beside them close i keep until we reach the town of sleep endlinehere  three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing endlinehere  three of us aboard in the basket on the lea endlinehere  winds are in the air they are blowing in the spring and waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea endlinehere  where shall we adventure to day that were afloat wary of the weather and steering by a star endlinehere  shall it be to africa a steering of the boat to providence or babylon or off to malabar endlinehere  but heres a squadron a rowing on the sea cattle on the meadow a charging with a roar endlinehere  quick and well escape them theyre as mad as they can be the wicket is the harbor and the garden is the shore endlinehere  the coach is at the door at last the eager children mounting fast and kissing hands in chorus sing good bye good bye to everything endlinehere  to house and garden field and lawn the meadow gates we swung upon to pump and stable tree and swing good bye good bye to everything endlinehere  and fare you well for evermore o ladder at the hayloft door o hayloft where the cobwebs cling good bye good bye to everything endlinehere  crack goes the whip and off we go the trees and houses smaller grow last round the woody turn we swing good bye good bye to everything endlinehere  when i was sick and lay a bed i had two pillows at my head and all my toys beside me lay to keep me happy all the day endlinehere  and sometimes for an hour or so i watched my leaden soldiers go with different uniforms and drills among the bed clothes through the hills endlinehere  and sometimes sent my ships in fleets all up and down among the sheets or brought my trees and houses out and planted cities all about endlinehere  i was the giant great and still that sits upon the pillow hill and sees before him dale and plain the pleasant land of counterpane endlinehere  come up here o dusty feet endlinehere  the lights from the parlor and kitchen shone out through the blinds and the windows and bars and high over head and all moving about there were thousands of millions of stars endlinehere  we built a ship upon the stairs all made of the back bedroom chairs and filled it full of sofa pillows to go a sailing on the billows endlinehere  we sailed along for days and days and had the very best of plays but tom fell out and hurt his knee so there was no one left but me endlinehere  bring the comb and play upon it endlinehere  marching here we come endlinehere  willie cocks his highland bonnet johnnie beats the drum endlinehere  mary jane commands the party peter leads the rear feet in time alert and hearty each a grenadier endlinehere  all in the most martial manner marching double quick while the napkin like a banner waves upon the stick endlinehere  heres enough of fame and pillage great commander jane endlinehere  now that weve been round the village lets go home again endlinehere  dark brown is the river golden is the sand endlinehere  it flows along for ever with trees on either hand endlinehere  green leaves a floating castles of the foam boats of mine a boating where will all come home endlinehere  on goes the river and out past the mill away down the valley away down the hill endlinehere  away down the river a hundred miles or more other little children shall bring my boats ashore endlinehere  through all the pleasant meadow side the grass grew shoulder high till the shining scythes went far and wide and cut it down to dry endlinehere  these green and sweetly smelling crops they led in wagons home and they piled them here in mountain tops for mountaineers to roam endlinehere  here is mount clear mount rusty nail mount eagle and mount high the mice that in these mountains dwell no happier are than i endlinehere  o what a joy to clamber there o what a place for play with the sweet the dim the dusty air the happy hills of hay endlinehere  whenever auntie moves around her dresses make a curious sound endlinehere  they trail behind her up the floor and trundle after through the door endlinehere  the friendly cow all red and white i love with all my heart she gives me cream with all her might to eat with apple tart endlinehere  she wanders lowing here and there and yet she cannot stray all in the pleasant open air the pleasant light of day endlinehere  and blown by all the winds that pass and wet with all the showers she walks among the meadow grass and eats the meadow flowers endlinehere  up into the cherry tree who should climb but little me endlinehere  i held the trunk with both my hands and looked abroad on foreign lands endlinehere  i saw the next door garden lie adorned with flowers before my eye and many pleasant places more that i had never seen before endlinehere  i saw the dimpling river pass and be the skys blue looking glass the dusty roads go up and down with people tramping into town endlinehere  if i could find a higher tree farther and farther i should see to where the grown up river slips into the sea among the ships endlinehere  to where the roads on either hand lead onward into fairy land where all the children dine at five and all the playthings come alive endlinehere  every night my prayers i say and get my dinner every day and every day that ive been good i get an orange after food endlinehere  the child that is not clean and neat with lots of toys and things to eat he is a naughty child im sure or else his dear papa is poor endlinehere  my holes were hollow like a cup in every hole the sea came up till it could hold no more endlinehere  all by myself i have to go with none to tell me what to do all alone beside the streams and up the mountain sides of dreams endlinehere  the strangest things are there for me both things to eat and things to see and many frightening sights abroad till morning in the land of nod endlinehere  try as i like to find the way i never can get back by day nor can remember plain and clear the curious music that i hear endlinehere  whenever the moon and stars are set whenever the wind is high all night long in the dark and wet a man goes riding by endlinehere  late in the night when the fires are out why does he gallop and gallop about endlinehere  whenever the trees are crying aloud and ships are tossed at sea by on the highway low and loud by at the gallop goes he endlinehere  by at the gallop he goes and then by he comes back at the gallop again endlinehere  a birdie with a yellow bill hopped up on the window sill cocked his shining eye and said aint you shamed you sleepy head endlinehere  the rain is raining all around endlinehere  it falls on field and tree it rains on the umbrellas here and on the ships at sea endlinehere  little indian sioux or crow little frosty eskimo little turk or japanee o endlinehere  dont you wish that you were me endlinehere  you have seen the scarlet trees and the lions over seas you have eaten ostrich eggs and turned the turtles off their legs endlinehere  such a life is very fine but its not so nice as mine you must often as you trod have wearied _not_ to be abroad endlinehere  you have curious things to eat i am fed on proper meat you must dwell beyond the foam but i am safe and live at home endlinehere  when i am grown to mans estate i shall be very proud and great and tell the other girls and boys not to meddle with my toys endlinehere  i have a little shadow that goes in and out with me and what can be the use of him is more than i can see endlinehere  he is very very like me from the heels up to the head and i see him jump before me when i jump into my bed endlinehere  he hasnt got a notion of how children ought to play and can only make a fool of me in every sort of way endlinehere  he stays so close beside me hes a coward you can see id think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me endlinehere  the sun is not a bed when i at night upon my pillow lie still round the earth his way he takes and morning after morning makes endlinehere  while here at home in shining day we round the sunny garden play each little indian sleepy head is being kissed and put to bed endlinehere  and when at eve i rise from tea day dawns beyond the atlantic sea and all the children in the west are getting up and being dressed endlinehere  smooth it slides upon its travel here a wimple there a gleam o the clean gravel endlinehere  o the smooth stream endlinehere  sailing blossoms silver fishes paven pools as clear as air how a child wishes to live down there endlinehere  see the rings pursue each other all below grows black as night just as if mother had blown out the light endlinehere  patience children just a minute see the spreading circles die the stream and all in it will clear by and by endlinehere  of speckled eggs the birdie sings and nests among the trees the sailor sings of ropes and things in ships upon the seas endlinehere  the children sing in far japan the children sing in spain the organ with the organ man is singing in the rain endlinehere  my bed is like a little boat nurse helps me in when i embark she girds me in my sailors coat and starts me in the dark endlinehere  at night i go on board and say good night to all my friends on shore i shut my eyes and sail away and see and hear no more endlinehere  and sometimes things to bed i take as prudent sailors have to do perhaps a slice of wedding cake perhaps a toy or two endlinehere  all night across the dark we steer but when the day returns at last safe in my room beside the pier i find my vessel fast endlinehere  over the borders a sin without pardon breaking the branches and crawling below out through the breach in the wall of the garden down by the banks of the river we go endlinehere  here is the mill with the humming of thunder here is the weir with the wonder of foam here is the sluice with the race running under marvelous places though handy to home endlinehere  years may go by and the wheel in the river wheel as it wheels for us children to day endlinehere  wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever long after all of the boys are away endlinehere  home from the indies and home from the ocean heroes and soldiers we all shall come home still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion turning and churning that river to foam endlinehere  you with the bean that i gave when we quarreled i with your marble of saturday last honored and old and all gaily apparelled here we shall meet and remember the past endlinehere  when children are playing alone on the green in comes the playmate that never was seen endlinehere  when children are happy and lonely and good the friend of the children comes out of the wood endlinehere  nobody heard him and nobody saw his is a picture you never could draw but hes sure to be present abroad or at home when children are happy and playing alone endlinehere  i saw you toss the kites on high and blow the birds about the sky and all around i heard you pass like ladies skirts across the grass o wind a blowing all day long endlinehere  o wind that sings so loud a song endlinehere  i saw the different things you did but always you yourself you hid endlinehere  i felt you push i heard you call i could not see yourself at all o wind a blowing all day long o wind that sings so loud a song endlinehere  o you that are so strong and cold o blower are you young or old endlinehere  are you a beast of field and tree or just a stronger child than me endlinehere  o wind a blowing all day long o wind that sings so loud a song endlinehere  i woke before the morning i was happy all the day i never said an ugly word but smiled and stuck to play endlinehere  and now at last the sun is going down behind the wood and i am very happy for i know that ive been good endlinehere  my bed is waiting cool and fresh with linen smooth and fair and i must off to sleepsin by and not forget my prayer endlinehere  i know that till to morrow i shall see the sun arise no ugly dream shall fright my mind no ugly sight my eyes endlinehere  but slumber hold me tightly till i waken in the dawn and hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn endlinehere  children you are very little and your bones are very brittle if you would grow great and stately you must try to walk sedately endlinehere  you must still be bright and quiet and content with simple diet and remain through all bewildring innocent and honest children endlinehere  happy hearts and happy faces happy play in grassy places that was how in ancient ages children grew to kings and sages endlinehere  but the unkind and the unruly and the sort who eat unduly they must never hope for glory theirs is quite a different story endlinehere  cruel children crying babies all grow up as geese and gabies hated as their age increases by their nephews and their nieces endlinehere  summer fading winter comes frosty mornings tingling thumbs window robins winter rooks and the picture story books endlinehere  water now is turned to stone nurse and i can walk upon still we find the flowing brooks in the picture story books endlinehere  all the pretty things put by wait upon the childrens eye sheep and shepherds trees and crooks in the picture story books endlinehere  we may see how all things are seas and cities near and far and the flying fairies looks in the picture story books endlinehere  how am i to sing your praise happy chimney corner days sitting safe in nursery nooks reading picture story books endlinehere  how do you like to go up in a swing up in the air so blue endlinehere  oh i do think it the pleasantest thing ever a child can do endlinehere  it is very nice to think the world is full of meat and drink with little children saying grace in every christian kind of place endlinehere  the lamps now glitter down the street faintly sound the falling feet and the blue even slowly falls about the garden trees and walls endlinehere  now in the falling of the gloom the red fire paints the empty room and warmly on the roof it looks and flickers on the backs of books endlinehere  armies march by tower and spire of cities blazing in the fire till as i gaze with staring eyes the armies fade the lustre dies endlinehere  then once again the glow returns again the phantom city burns and down the red hot valley lo endlinehere  the phantom armies marching go endlinehere  blinking embers tell me true where are those armies marching to and what the burning city is that crumbles in your furnaces endlinehere  down by a shining water well i found a very little dell no higher than my head endlinehere  the heather and the gorse about in summer bloom were coming out some yellow and some red endlinehere  i called the little pool a sea the little hills were big to me for i am very small endlinehere  i made a boat i made a town i searched the caverns up and down and named them one and all endlinehere  and all about was mine i said the little sparrows overhead the little minnows too endlinehere  this was the world and i was king for me the bees came by to sing for me the swallows flew endlinehere  i played there were no deeper seas nor any wider plains than these nor other kings than me endlinehere  at last i heard my mother call out from the house at evenfall to call me home to tea endlinehere  and i must rise and leave my dell and leave my dimpled water well and leave my heather blooms endlinehere  and as my home i neared how very big my nurse appeared how great and cool the rooms endlinehere  all round the house is the jet black night it stares through the window pane it crawls in the corners hiding from the light and it moves with the moving flame endlinehere  now my little heart goes a beating like a drum with the breath of bogie in my hair and all round the candle the crooked shadows come and go marching along up the stair endlinehere  the shadow of the balusters the shadow of the lamp the shadow of the child that goes to bed all the wicked shadows coming tramp tramp tramp with the black night overhead endlinehere  late lies the wintry sun a bed a frosty fiery sleepy head blinks but an hour or two and then a blood red orange sets again endlinehere  before the stars have left the skies at morning in the dark i rise and shivering in my nakedness by the cold candle bathe and dress endlinehere  close by the jolly fire i sit to warm my frozen bones a bit or with a reindeer sled explore the colder countries round the door endlinehere  when to go out my nurse doth wrap me in my comforter and cap the cold wind burns my face and blows its frosty pepper up my nose endlinehere  black are my steps on silver sod thick blows my frosty breath abroad and tree and house and hill and lake are frosted like a wedding cake endlinehere  i can in the sorrel sit where the ladybird alit endlinehere  i can climb the jointed grass and on high see the greater swallows pass in the sky and the round sun rolling by heeding no such things as i endlinehere  through that forest i can pass till as in a looking glass humming fly and daisy tree and my tiny self i see painted very clear and neat on the rain pool at my feet endlinehere  should a leaflet come to land drifting near to where i stand straight ill board that tiny boat round the rain pool sea to float endlinehere  little thoughtful creatures sit on the grassy coasts of it little things with lovely eyes see me sailing with surprise endlinehere  some are clad in armour green these have sure to battle been endlinehere  some are pied with evry hue black and crimson gold and blue some have wings and swift are gone but they all look kindly on endlinehere  last to the chamber where i lie my fearful footsteps patter nigh and come from out the cold and gloom into my warm and cheerful room endlinehere  there safe arrived we turn about to keep the coming shadows out and close the happy door at last on all the perils that we passed endlinehere  then when mamma goes by to bed she shall come in with tip toe tread and see me lying warm and fast and in the land of nod at last endlinehere  when the golden day is done through the closing portal child and garden flower and sun vanish all things mortal endlinehere  as the blinding showers fall as the rays diminish under evenings cloak they all roll away and vanish endlinehere  garden darkened daisy shut child in bed they slumber glow worm in the highway rut mice among the lumber endlinehere  in the darkness houses shine parents move with candles till on all the night divine turns the bedroom handles endlinehere  till at last the day begins in the east a breaking in the hedges and the whins sleeping birds a waking endlinehere  in the darkness shapes of things houses trees and hedges clearer grow and sparrows wings beat on window ledges endlinehere  these shall wake the yawning maid she the door shall open finding dew on garden glade and the morning broken endlinehere  there my garden grows again green and rosy painted as at eve behind the pane from my eyes it fainted endlinehere  just as it was shut away toy like in the even here i see it glow with day under glowing heaven endlinehere  every path and every plot every bush of roses every blue forget me not where the dew reposes endlinehere  they cry the day is come on the smiling valleys we have beat the morning drum playmate join your allies endlinehere  birds all the sunny day flutter and quarrel here in the arbor like tent of the laurel endlinehere  here in the fork the brown nest is seated four little blue eggs the mother keeps heated endlinehere  while we stand watching her staring like gabies safe in each egg are the birds little babies endlinehere  soon the frail eggs they shall chip and upspringing make all the april woods merry with singing endlinehere  younger than we are o children and frailer soon in blue air theyll be singer and sailor endlinehere  we so much older taller and stronger we shall look down on the birdies no longer endlinehere  they shall go flying with musical speeches high over head in the tops of the beeches endlinehere  in spite of our wisdom and sensible talking we on our feet must go plodding and walking endlinehere  all the names i know from nurse gardeners garters shepherds purse bachelors buttons ladys smock and the lady hollyhock endlinehere  fairy places fairy things fairy woods where the wild bee wings tiny trees for tiny dames these must all be fairy names endlinehere  tiny woods below whose boughs shady fairies weave a house tiny tree tops rose or thyme where the braver fairies climb endlinehere  fair are grown up peoples trees but the fairest woods are these where if i were not so tall i should live for good and all endlinehere  here is a child who clambers and scrambles all by himself and gathering brambles here is a tramp who stands and gazes and there is the green for stringing the daisies endlinehere  here is a cart run away in the road lumping along with man and load and here is a mill and there is a river each a glimpse and gone forever endlinehere  this whistle we made and how clearly it sounds endlinehere  by the side of a field at the end of the grounds endlinehere  of a branch of a plane with a knife of my own it was nursie who made it and nursie alone endlinehere  what are you able to build with your blocks endlinehere  castles and palaces temples and docks endlinehere  rain may keep raining and others go roam but i can be happy and building at home endlinehere  this one is sailing and that one is moored hark to the song of the sailors on board endlinehere  and see the steps of my palace the kings coming and going with presents and things endlinehere  now i have done with it down let it go endlinehere  all in a moment the town is laid low endlinehere  block upon block lying scattered and free what is there left of my town by the sea endlinehere  the gardener does not love to talk he makes me keep the gravel walk and when he puts his tools away he locks the door and takes the key endlinehere  away behind the currant row where no one else but cook may go far in the plots i see him dig old and serious brown and big endlinehere  he digs the flowers green red and blue nor wishes to be spoken to endlinehere  he digs the flowers and cuts the hay and never seems to want to play endlinehere  summer goes and winter comes with pinching toes when in the garden bare and brown you must lay your barrow down endlinehere  well now and while the summer stays to profit by these garden days o how much wiser you would be to play at indian wars with me endlinehere  heres peace for you and surety here the one wisdom the truth endlinehere  all day the good glad sun showers love and labour on you wine and song the greenwood laughs the wind blows all day long till night endlinehere  and night ends all things endlinehere  then shall be no lamp relumed in heaven no voices crying or changing lights or dreams and forms that hover endlinehere  and heart for all your sighing that gladness and those tears are over over endlinehere  and has the truth brought no new hope at all heart that youre weeping yet for paradise endlinehere  do they still whisper the old weary cries endlinehere  mid youth and song feasting and carnival through laughter through the roses as of old comes death on shadowy and relentless feet death unappeasable by prayer or gold death is the end the end endlinehere  proud then clear eyed and laughing go to greet death as a friend endlinehere  exile of immortality strongly wise strain through the dark with undesirous eyes to what may lie beyond it endlinehere  sets your star o heart for ever endlinehere  yet behind the night waits for the great unborn somewhere afar some white tremendous daybreak endlinehere  tenderly day that i have loved i close your eyes and smooth your quiet brow and fold your thin dead hands endlinehere  the grey veils of the half light deepen colour dies endlinehere  i bear you a light burden to the shrouded sands where lies your waiting boat by wreaths of the seas making mist garlanded with all grey weeds of the water crowned endlinehere  beyond the shifting cold twilight further than laughter goes or tears further than dreaming therell be no port no dawn lit islands endlinehere  but the drear waste darkening and at length flame ultimate on the deep endlinehere  oh the last fire and you unkissed unfriended there endlinehere  oh the lone ways red ending and we not there to weep endlinehere  we found you pale and quiet and strangely crowned with flowers lovely and secret as a child endlinehere  you came with us came happily hand in hand with the young dancing hours high on the downs at dawn endlinehere  void now and tenebrous the grey sands curve before me endlinehere  from the inland meadows fragrant of june and clover floats the dark and fills the hollow seas dead face with little creeping shadows and the white silence brims the hollow of the hills endlinehere  close in the nest is folded every weary wing hushed all the joyful voices and we who held you dear eastward we turn and homeward alone remembering endlinehere  day that i loved day that i loved the night is here endlinehere  i cower to the earth i waking i only endlinehere  high and cold thou dreamest o queen high dreaming and lonely endlinehere  and around me the feet of thy watchers tread endlinehere  there is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head an intolerable radiance of wings endlinehere  all the earth grows fire white lips of desire brushing cool on the forehead croon slumbrous things endlinehere  earth fades and the air is thrilled with ways dewy paths full of comfort endlinehere  from quiet skies in through the window my lord the sun endlinehere  and my eyes were dazzled and drunk with the misty gold the golden glory that drowned and crowned me eddied and swayed through the room endlinehere  around me to left and to right hunched figures and old dull blear eyed scribbling fools grew fair ringed round and haloed with holy light endlinehere  till the light faded and they were but fools again fools unknowing still scribbling blear eyed and stolid immortals endlinehere  id watched the sorrow of the evening sky and smelt the sea and earth and the warm clover and heard the waves and the seagulls mocking cry endlinehere  and in them all was only the old cry that song they always sing the best is over endlinehere  you may remember now and think and sigh o silly lover endlinehere  and i was tired and sick that all was over and because i for all my thinking never could recover one moment of the good hours that were over endlinehere  and i was sorry and sick and wished to die endlinehere  then from the sad west turning wearily i saw the pines against the white north sky very beautiful and still and bending over their sharp black heads against a quiet sky endlinehere  and there was peace in them and i was happy and forgot to play the lover and laughed and did no longer wish to die being glad of you o pine trees and the sky endlinehere  creeps in half wanton half asleep one with a fat wide hairless face endlinehere  he likes love music that is cheap likes women in a crowded place and wants to hear the noise theyre making endlinehere  his heavy eyelids droop half over great pouches swing beneath his eyes endlinehere  he listens thinks himself the lover heaves from his stomach wheezy sighs he likes to feel his hearts a breaking endlinehere  his little lips are bright with slime endlinehere  the music swells endlinehere  the women shiver endlinehere  and all the while in perfect time his pendulous stomach hangs a shaking endlinehere  all the shade is rife with magic and movement endlinehere  i stray alone here on the edge of silence half afraid waiting a sign endlinehere  in the deep heart of me the sullen waters swell towards the moon and all my tides set seaward endlinehere  from inland leaps a gay fragment of some mocking tune that tinkles and laughs and fades along the sand and dies between the seawall and the sea endlinehere  song of a tribe of the ancient egyptians the priests within the temple she was wrinkled and huge and hideous endlinehere  she was our mother endlinehere  she was lustful and lewd endlinehere  but a god we had none other endlinehere  in the day she was hidden and dumb but at nightfall moaned in the shade we shuddered and gave her her will in the darkness we were afraid endlinehere  the people without she sent us pain and we bowed before her she smiled again and bade us adore her endlinehere  she solaced our woe and soothed our sighing and what shall we do now god is dying endlinehere  the priests within she was hungry and ate our children how should we stay her endlinehere  she took our young men and our maidens ours to obey her endlinehere  we were loathed and mocked and reviled of all nations that was our pride endlinehere  she fed us protected us loved us and killed us now she has died endlinehere  the people without she was so strong but death is stronger endlinehere  she ruled us long but time is longer endlinehere  halted around the fire by night after moon set they sing this beneath the trees endlinehere  what light of unremembered skies hast thou relumed within our eyes thou whom we seek whom we shall find endlinehere  a certain odour on the wind thy hidden face beyond the west these things have called us on a quest older than any road we trod more endless than desire endlinehere  far god sigh with thy cruel voice that fills the soul with longing for dim hills and faint horizons endlinehere  for there come grey moments of the antient dumb sickness of travel when no song can cheer us but the way seems long and one remembers endlinehere  the beat of weary unreturning feet and songs of pilgrims unreturning endlinehere  the fires we left are always burning on the old shrines of home endlinehere  our kin have built them temples and therein pray to the gods we know and dwell in little houses lovable being happy we remember how endlinehere  and peaceful even to death endlinehere  o thou god of all long desirous roaming our hearts are sick of fruitless homing and crying after lost desire endlinehere  as with fire consuming dreams of other bliss endlinehere  sung on one night in the cities in the darkness endlinehere  ye are sober and dull through the common day but now it is night endlinehere  it is shameful night and god is asleep endlinehere  have you not felt the quick fires that creep through the hungry flesh and the lust of delight and hot secrets of dreams that day cannot say endlinehere  the house is dumb the night calls out to you endlinehere  down the dim stairs through the creaking door naked crawling on hands and feet it is meet endlinehere  ye are men no longer but less and more beast and god endlinehere  down the lampless street by little black ways and secret places in the darkness and mire faint laughter around and evil faces by the star glint seen ah endlinehere  for the darkness whispers a blind desire and the fingers of night are amorous endlinehere  because god put his adamantine fate between my sullen heart and its desire i swore that i would burst the iron gate rise up and curse him on his throne of fire endlinehere  an idle wind blew round an empty throne and stirred the heavy curtains on the walls endlinehere  before thy shrine i kneel an unknown worshipper chanting strange hymns to thee and sorrowful litanies incense of dirges prayers that are as holy myrrh endlinehere  ah goddess on thy throne of tears and faint low sighs weary at last to theeward come the feet that err and empty hearts grown tired of the worlds vanities endlinehere  how fair this cool deep silence to a wanderer deaf with the roar of winds along the open skies endlinehere  sweet after sting and bitter kiss of sea water the pale lethean wine within thy chalices endlinehere  from the train between bologna and milan second class endlinehere  opposite me two germans snore and sweat endlinehere  through sullen swirling gloom we jolt and roar endlinehere  we have been here for ever even yet a dim watch tells two hours two aeons more endlinehere  the windows are tight shut and slimy wet with a nights foetor endlinehere  there are two hours more two hours to dawn and milan two hours yet endlinehere  opposite me two germans sweat and snore endlinehere  one of them wakes and spits and sleeps again endlinehere  the darkness shivers endlinehere  a wan light through the rain strikes on our faces drawn and white endlinehere  somewhere a new day sprawls and inside the foul air is chill and damp and fouler than before endlinehere  out of the nothingness of sleep the slow dreams of eternity there was a thunder on the deep i came because you called to me endlinehere  i broke the nights primeval bars i dared the old abysmal curse and flashed through ranks of frightened stars suddenly on the universe endlinehere  the eternal silences were broken hell became heaven as i passed endlinehere  what shall i give you as a token a sign that we have met at last endlinehere  ill break and forge the stars anew shatter the heavens with a song immortal in my love for you because i love you very strong endlinehere  then only in the empty spaces death walking very silently shall fear the glory of our faces through all the dark infinity endlinehere  so clothed about with perfect love the eternal end shall find us one alone above the night above the dust of the dead gods alone endlinehere  we leave this resting place made fair by one another for a while endlinehere  now for a god speed one last mad embrace the long road then unlit by your faint smile endlinehere  and you so far away endlinehere  oh ill remember endlinehere  each crawling day will pale a little your scarlet lips each mile dull the dear pain of your remembered face endlinehere  some day i shall rise and leave my friends and seek you again through the worlds far ends you whom i found so fair touch of your hands and smell of your hair endlinehere  my only god in the days that were endlinehere  my eager feet shall find you again though the sullen years and the mark of pain have changed you wholly for i shall know how could i forget having loved you so endlinehere  in the sad half light of evening the face that was all my sunrising endlinehere  and i loved you before you were old and wise when the flame of youth was strong in your eyes and my heart is sick with memories endlinehere  death will find me long before i tire of watching you and swing me suddenly into the shade and loneliness and mire of the last land endlinehere  there waiting patiently one day i think ill feel a cool wind blowing see a slow light across the stygian tide and hear the dead about me stir unknowing and tremble endlinehere  and turn and toss your brown delightful head amusedly among the ancient dead endlinehere  i said i splendidly loved you its not true endlinehere  such long swift tides stir not a land locked sea endlinehere  on gods or fools the high risk falls on you the clean clear bitter sweet thats not for me endlinehere  love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist endlinehere  love is flung lucifer like from heaven to hell endlinehere  pleasures not theirs nor pain endlinehere  they doubt and sigh and do not love at all endlinehere  of these am i endlinehere  or that foul you endlinehere  but this the strange gods who had given so much to have seen and known you this they might not do endlinehere  one last shames spared me one black words unspoken and im alone and you have not awoken endlinehere  one moment what it is to love endlinehere  and yet the best that eithers known will change and wither and be less at last than comfort or its own remembrance endlinehere  and when some caress tendered in habit once a flame all heaven sang out to wakes the shame unworded in the steady eyes well have that day what shall we do endlinehere  being so noble kill the two whove reached their second best endlinehere  being wise break cleanly off and get away endlinehere  follow down other windier skies new lures alone endlinehere  or shall we stay since this is all weve known content in the lean twilight of such day and not remember not lament endlinehere  so i from paint stone tale and rhyme stuffed loves infinity and sucked all lovers of all time to rarify ecstasy endlinehere  helens the hair shuts out from me veronas livid skies gypsy the lips i press and see two antonys in your eyes endlinehere  in a cool curving world he lies and ripples with dark ecstasies endlinehere  there slipping wave and shore are one and weed and mud endlinehere  and alls one endlinehere  gentle embracing quiet dun the world he rests in world he knows perpetual curving endlinehere  space is no more under the mud his bliss is older than the sun endlinehere  silent and straight the waters run endlinehere  the lights the cries the willows dim and the dark tide are one with him endlinehere  how can we find endlinehere  how can we rest endlinehere  how can we being gods win joy or peace being man endlinehere  loves for completeness endlinehere  no perfection grows twixt leg and arm elbow and ear and nose and joint and socket but unsatisfied sprawling desires shapeless perverse denied endlinehere  how can love triumph how can solace be where fever turns toward fever knee toward knee endlinehere  and i went on endlinehere  for if my echoing footfall slept soon a far whispering thered be of a little lonely wind that crept from tree to tree and distantly followed me followed me endlinehere  but the blue vaporous end of day brought peace and pursuit baffled quite where between pine woods dipped the way endlinehere  i turned slipped in and out of sight endlinehere  i trod as quiet as the night endlinehere  the pine boles kept perpetual hush and in the boughs wind never swirled endlinehere  i found a flowering lowly bush and bowed slid in and sighed and curled hidden at rest from all the world endlinehere  i was safe and glad i knew endlinehere  yet with cold heart and cold wet brows i lay endlinehere  and the dark fell endlinehere  there grew meward a sound of shaken boughs and ceased above my intricate house and silence silence silence found me endlinehere  i felt the unfaltering movement creep among the leaves endlinehere  they shed around me calm clouds of scent that i did weep and stroked my face endlinehere  i fell asleep endlinehere  breathless we flung us on the windy hill laughed in the sun and kissed the lovely grass endlinehere  you said through glory and ecstasy we pass wind sun and earth remain the birds sing still when we are old are old endlinehere  and when we die alls over that is ours and life burns on through other lovers other lips said i heart of my heart our heaven is now is won endlinehere  we are earths best that learnt her lesson here endlinehere  life is our cry endlinehere  we have kept the faith endlinehere  we said we shall go down with unreluctant tread rose crowned into the darkness endlinehere  proud we were and laughed that had such brave true things to say endlinehere  and then you suddenly cried and turned away endlinehere  i dreamt i was in love again with the one before the last and smiled to greet the pleasant pain of that innocent young past endlinehere  but i jumped to feel how sharp had been the pain when it did live how the faded dreams of nineteen ten were hell in nineteen five endlinehere  the boys woe was as keen and clear the boys love just as true and the one before the last my dear hurt quite as much as you endlinehere  sickly i pondered how the lover wrongs the unanswering tomb and sentimentalizes over what earned a better doom endlinehere  gently he tombs the poor dim last time strews pinkish dust above and sighs the dear dead boyish pastime endlinehere  but this ah god endlinehere  better oblivion hide dead true loves better the night enfold than men to eke the praise of new loves should lie about the old endlinehere  bitter thoughts i had in plenty endlinehere  but heres the worst of it i shall forget in nineteen twenty you ever hurt abit endlinehere  the stars a jolly company i envied straying late and lonely and cried upon their revelry o white companionship endlinehere  you only in love in faith unbroken dwell friends radiant and inseparable endlinehere  but i remembering pitied well and loved them who with lonely light in empty infinite spaces dwell disconsolate endlinehere  for all the night i heard the thin gnat voices cry star to faint star across the sky endlinehere  he wakes who never thought to wake again who held the end was death endlinehere  he opens eyes slowly to one long livid oozing plain closed down by the strange eyeless heavens endlinehere  he lies and waits and once in timeless sick surmise through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand like a dry branch endlinehere  i thought when love for you died i should die endlinehere  alone most strangely i live on endlinehere  was called ambarvalia swings the way still by hollow and hill and all the worlds a song shes far it sings me but fair it rings me quiet it laughs and strong endlinehere  spite of the miles and years between us spite of your chosen part i do remember and i go with laughter in my heart endlinehere  so above the little folk that know not out of the white hill town high up i clamber and i remember and watch the day go down endlinehere  theyll call the news from hill to hill dark and uncomforted earth and sky and the winds and i shall know that you are dead endlinehere  i shall not hear your trentals nor eat your arval bread for the kin of you will surely do their duty by the dead endlinehere  their little dull greasy eyes will water theyll paw you and gulp afresh endlinehere  theyll sniffle and weep and their thoughts will creep like flies on the cold flesh endlinehere  they will put pence on your grey eyes bind up your fallen chin and lay you straight the fools that loved you because they were your kin endlinehere  they will praise all the bad about you and hush the good away and wonder how theyll do without you and then theyll go away endlinehere  with snuffle and sniff and handkerchief and dim and decorous mirth with ham and sherry theyll meet to bury the lordliest lass of earth endlinehere  the little dead hearts will tramp ungrieving behind lone riding you the heart so high the heart so living heart that they never knew endlinehere  i shall not hear your trentals nor eat your arval bread nor with smug breath tell lies of death to the unanswering dead endlinehere  with snuffle and sniff and handkerchief the folk who loved you not will bury you and go wondering back home endlinehere  and you will rot endlinehere  but laughing and half way up to heaven with wind and hill and star i yet shall keep before i sleep your ambarvalia endlinehere  there was a damned successful poet there was a woman like the sun endlinehere  and they were dead endlinehere  they did not know it endlinehere  they did not know their time was done endlinehere  they did not know his hymns were silence and her limbs that had served love so well dust and a filthy smell endlinehere  so knee to knee they sped again and laugh to laugh they ran im told across the streets of hell endlinehere  and then they suddenly felt the wind blow cold and knew so closely pressed chill air on lip and breast and with a sick surprise the emptiness of eyes endlinehere  here where loves stuff is body arm and side are stabbing sweet gainst chair and lamp and wall endlinehere  in every touch more intimate meanings hide and flaming brains are the white heart of all endlinehere  here million pulses to one centre beat closed in by mens vast friendliness alone two can be drunk with solitude and meet on the sheer point where sense with knowings one endlinehere  though the woods are quiet and youve heard night creep along the hedges endlinehere  never go where tangled foliage shrouds the crying bird and the remote winds sigh and waters flow endlinehere  for moveless limbs no pity i crave that never were swift endlinehere  still all i prize laughter and thought and friends i have no fool to heave luxurious sighs for the woods and hills that i never knew endlinehere  the more excellent ways yet mine endlinehere  and you flower laden come to the clean white cell and we talk as ever am i not the same endlinehere  with our hearts we love immutable you without pity i without shame endlinehere  we talk as of old as of old you go out under the sky and laughing i know flit through the streets your heart all me till you gain the world beyond the town endlinehere  then i fade from your heart quietly and your fleet steps quicken endlinehere  the strong down smiles you welcome there the woods that love you close lovely and conquering arms above you endlinehere  o ever moving o lithe and free endlinehere  fast in my linen prison i press on impassable bars or emptily laugh in my great loneliness endlinehere  and still in the white neat bed i strive most impotently against that gyve being less now than a thought even to you alone with your hills and heaven endlinehere  i hot through troys ruin menelaus broke to priams palace sword in hand to sate on that adulterous whore a ten years hate and a kings honour endlinehere  through red death and smoke and cries and then by quieter ways he strode till the still innermost chamber fronted him endlinehere  he swung his sword and crashed into the dim luxurious bower flaming like a god endlinehere  high sat white helen lonely and serene endlinehere  he had not remembered that she was so fair and that her neck curved down in such a way and he felt tired endlinehere  he flung the sword away and kissed her feet and knelt before her there the perfect knight before the perfect queen endlinehere  ii so far the poet endlinehere  how should he behold that journey home the long connubial years endlinehere  he does not tell you how white helen bears child on legitimate child becomes a scold haggard with virtue endlinehere  menelaus bold waxed garrulous and sacked a hundred troys twixt noon and supper endlinehere  and her golden voice got shrill as he grew deafer endlinehere  and both were old endlinehere  often he wonders why on earth he went troyward or why poor paris ever came endlinehere  oft she weeps gummy eyed and impotent her dry shanks twitch at paris mumbled name endlinehere  so menelaus nagged and helen cried and paris slept on by scamander side endlinehere  how should i know endlinehere  the enormous wheels of will drove me cold eyed on tired and sleepless feet endlinehere  night was void arms and you a phantom still and day your far light swaying down the street endlinehere  as never fool for love i starved for you my throat was dry and my eyes hot to see endlinehere  your mouth so lying was most heaven in view and your remembered smell most agony endlinehere  i felt your hot wrist shiver and suddenly the mad victory i planned flashed real in your burning bending head endlinehere  my conquerors blood was cool as a deep river in shadow and my heart beneath your hand quieter than a dead man on a bed endlinehere  day after day youll sit with him and note the greasier tie the dingy wrinkling coat as prettiness turns to pomp and strength to fat and love love love to habit endlinehere  o lithe and free and lightfoot that the poor heart cries to see thats how ill see your man and you endlinehere  but you oh when that time comes youll be dirty too endlinehere  my restless blood now lies a quiver knowing that always exquisitely this april twilight on the river stirs anguish in the heart of me endlinehere  and all these like a waiting lover murmur and gleam lift lustrous eyes drift close to me and sideways bending whisper delicious words endlinehere  but i stretch terrible hands uncomprehending shaken with love and laugh and cry endlinehere  and hatred followed after shrilling madly down the breeze endlinehere  in peace from the wild heart of clamour a flower in moonlight she was there was rippling down white ways of glamour quietly laid on wave and air endlinehere  her passing left no leaf a quiver endlinehere  pale flowers wreathed her white white brows endlinehere  her feet were silence on the river and hush endlinehere  she said between the boughs endlinehere  in darkness the loud sea makes moan and earth is shaken and all evils creep about her ways endlinehere  oh now to know you sleep endlinehere  your magic and your beauty and your strength like hills at noon or sunlight on a tree sleeping prevail in earth and air endlinehere  in the sweet gloom above the brown and white night benedictions hover and the winds of night move gently round the room and watch you there endlinehere  and still the darkness ebbs about your bed endlinehere  quiet and strange and loving kind you sleep endlinehere  and holy joy about the earth is shed and holiness upon the deep endlinehere  from the candles and dumb shadows and the house where love had died i stole to the vast moonlight and the whispering life outside endlinehere  but i found no lips of comfort no home in the moons light i little and lone and frightened in the unfriendly night and no meaning in the voices endlinehere  far over the lands and through the dark beyond the ocean i willed to think of you endlinehere  for i knew had you been with me id have known the words of night found peace of heart gone gladly in comfort of that light endlinehere  but ever desperately i willed till all grew soft and far and silent endlinehere  and suddenly i found you white and radiant sleeping quietly far out through the tides of darkness endlinehere  love they said is king of kings and triumph is his crown endlinehere  earth fades in flame before his wings and sun and moon bow down endlinehere  but that i knew would never do and heaven is all too high endlinehere  so whenever i meet a queen i said i will not catch her eye endlinehere  love they said and love they said the gift of love is this a crown of thorns about thy head and vinegar to thy kiss endlinehere  but tragedy is not for me and im content to be gay endlinehere  so whenever i spied a tragic lady i went another way endlinehere  and so i never feared to see you wander down the street or come across the fields to me on ordinary feet endlinehere  for what theyd never told me of and what i never knew it was that all the time my love love would be merely you endlinehere  safe in the magic of my woods i lay and watched the dying light endlinehere  faint in the pale high solitudes and washed with rain and veiled by night silver and blue and green were showing endlinehere  the spell was broken the key denied me and at length your flat clear voice beside me mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes endlinehere  you came and quacked beside me in the wood endlinehere  you said the view from here is very good endlinehere  you said its nice to be alone a bit endlinehere  and how the days are drawing out endlinehere  you said the sunsets pretty isnt it endlinehere  i wish i wish that you were dead endlinehere  lip and eye flashed on the glory shone and cried improvident unmemoried and fitfully and like a flame the light of laughter went and came endlinehere  proud in their careless transience moved the changing faces that i loved endlinehere  till suddenly and otherwhence i looked upon your innocence endlinehere  for lifted clear and still and strange from the dark woven flow of change under a vast and starless sky i saw the immortal moment lie endlinehere  one instant i an instant knew as god knows all endlinehere  and it and you i above time oh blind endlinehere  could see in witless immortality endlinehere  i saw the marble cup the tea hung on the air an amber stream i saw the fires unglittering gleam the painted flame the frozen smoke endlinehere  light was more alive than you endlinehere  for suddenly and otherwhence i looked on your magnificence endlinehere  dazed at length human eyes grew mortal strength wearied and time began to creep endlinehere  change closed about me like a sleep endlinehere  light glinted on the eyes i loved endlinehere  the cup was filled endlinehere  the bodies moved endlinehere  the drifting petal came to ground endlinehere  the laughter chimed its perfect round endlinehere  the broken syllable was ended endlinehere  and i so certain and so friended how could i cloud or how distress the heaven of your unconsciousness endlinehere  or shake at times sufficient spell stammering of lights unutterable endlinehere  the eternal holiness of you the timeless end you never knew the peace that lay the light that shone endlinehere  you never knew that i had gone a million miles away and stayed a million years endlinehere  the laughter played unbroken round me and the jest flashed on endlinehere  and we that knew the best down wonderful hours grew happier yet endlinehere  i sang at heart and talked and eat and lived from laugh to laugh i too when you were there and you and you endlinehere  in a flowered dell the lady venus stood amazed with sorrow endlinehere  down the morning one far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun rang out and held and died endlinehere  she thought the wood grew quieter endlinehere  wing and leaf and pool of light forgot to dance endlinehere  dumb lay the unfalling stream life one eternal instant rose in dream clear out of time poised on a golden height endlinehere  till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour endlinehere  the gold waves purled amidst the green above her and a bird sang endlinehere  with one sharp taken breath by sunlit branches and unshaken flower the immortal limbs flashed to the human lover and the immortal eyes to look on death endlinehere  the damned ship lurched and slithered endlinehere  quiet and quick my cold gorge rose the long sea rolled i knew i must think hard of something or be sick and could think hard of only one thing you endlinehere  you you alone could hold my fancy ever endlinehere  and with you memories come sharp pain and dole endlinehere  now theres a choice heartache or tortured liver endlinehere  a sea sick body or a you sick soul endlinehere  do i forget you endlinehere  retchings twist and tie me old meat good meals brown gobbets up i throw endlinehere  acrid return and slimy the sobs and slobber of a last years woe endlinehere  and still the sick ship rolls endlinehere  tis hard i tell ye to choose twixt love and nausea heart and belly endlinehere  all night the ways of heaven were desolate long roads across a gleaming empty sky endlinehere  outcast and doomed and driven you and i alone serene beyond all love or hate terror or triumph were content to wait we silent and all knowing endlinehere  suddenly swept through the heaven low crouching from on high one horseman downward to the earths low gate endlinehere  oh perfect from the ultimate height of living lightly we turned through wet woods blossom hung into the open endlinehere  down the supernal roads with plumes a tossing purple flags far flung rank upon rank unbridled unforgiving thundered the black battalions of the gods endlinehere  through my hearts palace thoughts unnumbered throng and there most quiet and as a child most wise high throned you sit and gracious endlinehere  all day long great hopes gold armoured jester fantasies and pilgrim dreams and little beggar sighs bow to your benediction go their way endlinehere  and the grave jewelled courtier memories worship and love and tend you all the day endlinehere  not now when desire burns and the wind calls and the suns of spring light foot dance in the woods whisper of life woo me to wayfaring ah endlinehere  not now should you come now when the road beckons and good friends call where are songs to be sung fights to be fought yea endlinehere  and the best of all love on myriad lips fairer than yours kisses you could not give endlinehere  dearest why should i mourn whimper and whine i that have yet to live endlinehere  sorrow will i forget tears for the best love on the lips of you now when dawn in the blood wakes and the sun laughs up the eastern blue ill forget and be glad endlinehere  still i abode strong in a golden dream unrecaptured endlinehere  and in the heart of it end of labouring you endlinehere  therefore i kept ready the altar lit the flame burning apart endlinehere  face of my dreams vainly in vision white gleaming down to me lo endlinehere  for about midnight whispers grew through the wood suddenly strange cries in the boughs above grated cries like a laugh endlinehere  silent and black then through the sacred grove great birds flew as a dream troubling the leaves passing at length endlinehere  therefore i go never to rest or win peace and worship of you more and the dumb wood and the shrine therein endlinehere  so light we were so right we were so fair faith shone and the way was laid so certainly that when id gone what dumb thing looked up at you endlinehere  was it something heard or a sudden cry that meekly and without a word you broke the faith and strangely weakly slipped apart endlinehere  you gave in you the proud of heart unbowed of heart endlinehere  was this friend the end of all that we could do endlinehere  and have you found the best for you the rest for you endlinehere  did you learn so suddenly and i not by endlinehere  some whispered story that stole the glory from the sky and ended all the splendid dream and made you go so dully from the fight we know the light we know endlinehere  the faith remains and i must pass gay down the way and on alone endlinehere  under the grass you wait the breeze moves in the trees and stirs and calls and covers you with white petals with light petals endlinehere  good sleep to you endlinehere  we have built a house that is not for times throwing endlinehere  we have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever endlinehere  war knows no power endlinehere  safe shall be my going secretly armed against all deaths endeavour safe though all safetys lost safe where men fall and if these poor limbs die safest of all endlinehere  blow out you bugles over the rich dead endlinehere  theres none of these so lonely and poor of old but dying has made us rarer gifts than gold endlinehere  blow bugles blow endlinehere  they brought us for our dearth holiness lacked so long and love and pain endlinehere  honour has come back as a king to earth and paid his subjects with a royal wage and nobleness walks in our ways again and we have come into our heritage endlinehere  these hearts were woven of human joys and cares washed marvellously with sorrow swift to mirth endlinehere  the years had given them kindness endlinehere  dawn was theirs and sunset and the colours of the earth endlinehere  these had seen movement and heard music known slumber and waking loved gone proudly friended felt the quick stir of wonder sat alone touched flowers and furs and cheeks endlinehere  all this is ended endlinehere  there are waters blown by changing winds to laughter and lit by the rich skies all day endlinehere  and after frost with a gesture stays the waves that dance and wandering loveliness endlinehere  he leaves a white unbroken glory a gathered radiance a width a shining peace under the night endlinehere  if i should die think only this of me that theres some corner of a foreign field that is for ever england endlinehere  mamua when our laughter ends and hearts and bodies brown as white are dust about the doors of friends or scent ablowing down the night then oh endlinehere  then the wise agree comes our immortality endlinehere  mamua there waits a land hard for us to understand endlinehere  out of time beyond the sun all are one in paradise you and pupure are one and tau and the ungainly wise endlinehere  and my laughter and my pain shall home to the eternal brain endlinehere  and therell no more be one who dreams under the ferns of crumbling stuff eyes of illusion mouth that seems all time entangled human love endlinehere  and youll no longer swing and sway divinely down the scented shade where feet to ambulation fade and moons are lost in endless day endlinehere  how shall we wind these wreaths of ours where there are neither heads nor flowers endlinehere  but well be missing the palms and sunlight and the south and theres an end i think of kissing when our mouths are one with mouth endlinehere  tau here mamua crown the hair and come away endlinehere  hear the calling of the moon and the whispering scents that stray about the idle warm lagoon endlinehere  hasten hand in human hand down the dark the flowered way along the whiteness of the sand and in the waters soft caress wash the mind of foolishness mamua until the day endlinehere  spend the glittering moonlight there pursuing down the soundless deep limbs that gleam and shadowy hair or floating lazy half asleep endlinehere  dive and double and follow after snare in flowers and kiss and call with lips that fade and human laughter and faces individual well this side of paradise endlinehere  theres little comfort in the wise endlinehere  love in you went passing by penetrative remote and rare like a bird in the wide air and as the bird it left no trace in the heaven of your face endlinehere  in your stupidity i found the sweet hush after a sweet sound endlinehere  all about you was the light that dims the greying end of night desire was the unrisen sun joy the day not yet begun with tree whispering to tree without wind quietly endlinehere  wisdom slept within your hair and long suffering was there and in the flowing of your dress undiscerning tenderness endlinehere  and when you thought it seemed to me infinitely and like a sea about the slight world you had known your vast unconsciousness was thrown endlinehere  o haven without wave or tide endlinehere  silence in which all songs have died endlinehere  holy book where hearts are still endlinehere  and home at length under the hill endlinehere  o mother quiet breasts of peace where love itself would faint and cease endlinehere  now ere the unthinking silence on that strife steals down i would cheat drowsy death so far my night shall be remembered for a star that outshone all the suns of all mens days endlinehere  shall i not crown them with immortal praise whom i have loved who have given me dared with me high secrets and in darkness knelt to see the inenarrable godhead of delight endlinehere  love is a flame we have beaconed the worlds night endlinehere  a city and we have built it these and i endlinehere  an emperor we have taught the world to die endlinehere  dear names and thousand other throng to me endlinehere  and these shall pass whatever passes not in the great hour nor all my passion all my prayers have power to hold them with me through the gate of death endlinehere  theyll play deserter turn with the traitor breath break the high bond we made and sell loves trust and sacramented covenant to the dust endlinehere  but the best ive known stays here and changes breaks grows old is blown about the winds of the world and fades from brains of living men and dies endlinehere  o dear my loves o faithless once again this one last gift i give that after men shall know and later lovers far removed praise you all these were lovely say he loved endlinehere  mataiea fish fly replete in depth of june dawdling away their watry noon ponder deep wisdom dark or clear each secret fishy hope or fear endlinehere  fish say they have their stream and pond but is there anything beyond endlinehere  this life cannot be all they swear for how unpleasant if it were endlinehere  one may not doubt that somehow good shall come of water and of mud and sure the reverent eye must see a purpose in liquidity endlinehere  we darkly know by faith we cry the future is not wholly dry endlinehere  mud unto mud endlinehere  death eddies near not here the appointed end not here endlinehere  but somewhere beyond space and time endlinehere  is wetter water slimier slime endlinehere  and there they trust there swimmeth one who swam ere rivers were begun immense of fishy form and mind squamous omnipotent and kind and under that almighty fin the littlest fish may enter in endlinehere  and in that heaven of all their wish there shall be no more land say fish endlinehere  this i know and yet i know doubts that will not be denied endlinehere  for if the soul be not in place what has laid trouble in her face endlinehere  and if the spirit be not there why is fragrance in the hair endlinehere  oh love is fair and love is rare my dear one she said but love goes lightly over endlinehere  i bowed her foolish head and kissed her hair and laughed at her endlinehere  such a child was she so new to love so true to love and she spoke so bitterly endlinehere  i have peace to weigh your worth now all is over but if to praise or blame you cannot say endlinehere  for who decries the loved decries the lover yet what man lauds the thing hes thrown away endlinehere  dear fool pity the fool who thought you clever endlinehere  dear wisdom do not mock the fool that missed you endlinehere  most fair the blind has lost your face for ever endlinehere  most foul how could i see you while i kissed you endlinehere  the poor love of fools and blind ive proved you for foul or lovely twas a fool that loved you endlinehere  somewhile before the dawn i rose and stept softly along the dim way to your room and found you sleeping in the quiet gloom and holiness about you as you slept endlinehere  i knelt there till your waking fingers crept about my head and held it endlinehere  i had rest unhoped this side of heaven beneath your breast endlinehere  i knelt a long time still nor even wept endlinehere  it was great wrong you did me and for gain of that poor moments kindliness and ease and sleepy mother comfort endlinehere  child you know how easily love leaps out to dreams like these who has seen them true endlinehere  and love thats wakened so takes all too long to lay asleep again endlinehere  waikiki october today i have been happy endlinehere  the pacific october warm perfumes like a breath from vine and tree drift down the darkness endlinehere  plangent hidden from eyes somewhere an eukaleli thrills and cries and stabs with pain the nights brown savagery endlinehere  and dark scents whisper and dim waves creep to me gleam like a womans hair stretch out and rise and new stars burn into the ancient skies over the murmurous soft hawaian sea endlinehere  down the blue night the unending columns press in noiseless tumult break and wave and flow now tread the far south or lift rounds of snow up to the white moons hidden loveliness endlinehere  some pause in their grave wandering comradeless and turn with profound gesture vague and slow as who would pray good for the world but know their benediction empty as they bless endlinehere  they say that the dead die not but remain near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth endlinehere  i think they ride the calm mid heaven as these in wise majestic melancholy train and watch the moon and the still raging seas and men coming and going on the earth endlinehere  there the sure suns of these pale shadows move there stand the immortal ensigns of our war our melting flesh fixed beauty there a star and perishing hearts imperishable love endlinehere  dear we know only that we sigh kiss smile each kiss lasts but the kissing and grief goes over love has no habitation but the heart endlinehere  on the dark flood we catch awhile cling and are borne into the night apart endlinehere  the laugh dies with the lips love with the lover endlinehere  south kensington makaweli now that weve done our best and worst and parted i would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend endlinehere  i would think of a thousand things lovely and durable and taste them slowly one after one like tasting a sweet food endlinehere  i have need to busy my heart with quietude endlinehere  love is a breach in the walls a broken gate where that comes in that shall not go again love sells the proud hearts citadel to fate endlinehere  they have known shame who love unloved endlinehere  some share that night endlinehere  but they know love grows colder grows false and dull that was sweet lies at most endlinehere  astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder but darkens and dies out from kiss to kiss endlinehere  all this is love and all love is but this endlinehere  heart you are restless as a paper scrap thats tossed down dusty pavements by the wind saying she is most wise patient and kind endlinehere  come to her come to her endlinehere  she will not care endlinehere  shell smile to see me come so that i think all heaven in flower to fold me endlinehere  shell give me all i ask kiss me and hold me and open wide upon that holy air the gates of peace and take my tiredness home kinder than god endlinehere  but heart she will not care endlinehere  your hands my dear adorable your lips of tenderness oh ive loved you faithfully and well three years or a bit less endlinehere  thank god thats done endlinehere  and ill take the road quit of my youth and you the roman road to wendover by tring and lilley hoo as a free man may do endlinehere  for youth goes over the joys that fly the tears that follow fast and the dirtiest things we do must lie forgotten at the last even love goes past endlinehere  whats left behind i shall not find the splendour and the pain the splash of sun the shouting wind and the brave sting of rain i may not meet again endlinehere  but the years that take the best away give something in the end and a better friend than love have they for none to mar or mend that have themselves to friend endlinehere  i shall desire and i shall find the best of my desires the autumn road the mellow wind that soothes the darkening shires endlinehere  and laughter and inn fires endlinehere  white mist about the black hedgerows the slumbering midland plain the silence where the clover grows and the dead leaves in the lane certainly these remain endlinehere  and i shall find some girl perhaps and a better one than you with eyes as wise but kindlier and lips as soft but true endlinehere  and i daresay she will do endlinehere  i came back late and tired last night into my little room to the long chair and the firelight and comfortable gloom endlinehere  i stood a moment fierce and still watching her neck and hair endlinehere  i made a step to her and saw that there was no one there endlinehere  it was some trick of the firelight that made me see her there endlinehere  it was a chance of shade and light and the cushion in the chair endlinehere  oh all you happy over the earth that night how could i sleep endlinehere  i lay and watched the lonely gloom and watched the moonlight creep from wall to basin round the room all night i could not sleep endlinehere  hands and lit faces eddy to a line the dazed last minutes click the clamour dies endlinehere  beyond the great swung arc o the roof divine night smoky scarvd with thousand coloured eyes glares the imperious mystery of the way endlinehere  thirsty for dark you feel the long limbed train throb stretch thrill motion slide pull out and sway strain for the far pause draw to strength again endlinehere  there is an end appointed o my soul endlinehere  crimson and green the signals burn the gloom is hung with steams far blowing livid streamers endlinehere  lost into god as lights in light we fly grown one with will end drunken huddled dreamers endlinehere  the white lights roar endlinehere  the sounds of the world die endlinehere  and lips and laughter are forgotten things endlinehere  speed sharpens grows endlinehere  into the night and on the strength and splendour of our purpose swings endlinehere  the lamps fade and the stars endlinehere  we are alone endlinehere  all suddenly the wind comes soft and spring is here again and the hawthorn quickens with buds of green and my heart with buds of pain endlinehere  my heart all winter lay so numb the earth so dead and frore that i never thought the spring would come or my heart wake any more endlinehere  but winters broken and earth has woken and the small birds cry again and the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds and my heart puts forth its pain endlinehere  they queerly find some healing so and strange attainment in the touch there is a secret lovers know i have read as much endlinehere  and theirs no longer joy nor smart changing or ending night or day but mouth to mouth and heart on heart so lovers say endlinehere  young mary loitering once her garden way felt a warm splendour grow in the april day as wine that blushes water through endlinehere  and soon out of the gold air of the afternoon one knelt before her hair he had or fire bound back above his ears with golden wire baring the eager marble of his face endlinehere  not mans nor womans was the immortal grace rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white and lighting the proud eyes with changeless light incurious endlinehere  calm as his wings and fair that presence filled the garden endlinehere  she stood there saying what would you sir endlinehere  he told his word blessed art thou of women endlinehere  her breath came quick as little flakes of snow endlinehere  her hands crept up her breast endlinehere  she did but know it was not hers endlinehere  she felt a trembling stir within her body a will too strong for her that held and filled and mastered all endlinehere  with eyes closed and a thousand soft short broken sighs she gave submission fearful meek and glad endlinehere  she wished to speak endlinehere  her heart was faint for telling to relate her limbs sweet treachery her strange high estate over and over whispering half revealing weeping and so find kindness to her healing endlinehere  twixt tears and laughter panic hurrying her she raised her eyes to that fair messenger endlinehere  he knelt unmoved immortal with his eyes gazing beyond her calm to the calm skies radiant untroubled in his wisdom kind endlinehere  his sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind endlinehere  being tired she bowed her head and said so be it endlinehere  the great wings were spread showering glory on the fields and fire endlinehere  the whole air singing bore him up and higher unswerving unreluctant endlinehere  soon he shone a gold speck in the gold skies then was gone endlinehere  the air was colder and grey endlinehere  behind them broken hearted came grief so noisy a widow that all said had he but wed her elder sister sorrow in her stead endlinehere  and by her trying to soothe her all the time the fatherless children colour tune and rhyme the sweet lad rhyme ran all uncomprehending endlinehere  then at the ways sad ending round the raw grave they stayd endlinehere  old wisdom read in mumbling tone the service for the dead endlinehere  beauty was there pale in her black dry eyed she stood alone endlinehere  poor mazd imagination fancy wild ardour the sunlight on his greying hair contentment who had known youth as a child and never seen him since endlinehere  and spring came too dancing over the tombs and brought him flowers she did not stay for long endlinehere  love had died long ago endlinehere  and i know how the may fields all golden show and when the day is young and sweet gild gloriously the bare feet that run to bathe endlinehere  du lieber gott endlinehere  here am i sweating sick and hot and there the shadowed waters fresh lean up to embrace the naked flesh endlinehere

there or earth or such endlinehere  and clever modern men have seen a faun a peeping through the green and felt the classics were not dead to glimpse a naiads reedy head or hear the goat foot piping low endlinehere  but these are things i do not know endlinehere  still in the dawnlit waters cool his ghostly lordship swims his pool and tries the strokes essays the tricks long learnt on hellespont or styx endlinehere  dan chaucer hears his river still chatter beneath a phantom mill endlinehere  tennyson notes with studious eye how cambridge waters hurry by endlinehere  till at a shiver in the skies vanishing with satanic cries the prim ecclesiastic rout leaves but a startled sleeper out grey heavens the first birds drowsy calls the falling house that never falls endlinehere  i will pack and take a train and get me to england once again endlinehere  strong men have run for miles and miles when one from cherry hinton smiles strong men have blanched and shot their wives rather than send them to st endlinehere  ives strong men have cried like babes bydam to hear what happened at babraham endlinehere  in grantchester their skins are white they bathe by day they bathe by night the women there do all they ought the men observe the rules of thought endlinehere  they love the good they worship truth they laugh uproariously in youth and when they get to feeling old they up and shoot themselves im told endlinehere  to see the branches stir across the moon at grantchester endlinehere  to smell the thrilling sweet and rotten unforgettable unforgotten river smell and hear the breeze sobbing in the little trees endlinehere  say do the elm clumps greatly stand still guardians of that holy land endlinehere  the chestnuts shade in reverend dream the yet unacademic stream endlinehere  is dawn a secret shy and cold anadyomene silver gold endlinehere  and sunset still a golden sea from haslingfield to madingley endlinehere  and after ere the night is born do hares come out about the corn endlinehere  oh is the water sweet and cool gentle and brown above the pool endlinehere  and laughs the immortal river still under the mill under the mill endlinehere  say is there beauty yet to find endlinehere  deep meadows yet for to forget the lies and truths and pain endlinehere  yet stands the church clock at ten to three endlinehere  and is there honey still for tea endlinehere  stars that seem so close and bright watched by lovers through the night swim in emptiness men say many a mile and year away endlinehere  and yonder star that burns so white may have died to dust and night

with hands delicious and it was well with us endlinehere  love came our quiet way lit pride in us and died in us all in a winters day endlinehere  there is no more to say endlinehere  and innocence accounted wise and faith the fool the pitiable endlinehere  love so rare one would swear all of earth for ever well careless lips and flying hair and little things i may not tell endlinehere  it does

of the accents upon all the norms endlinehere  the stress on the penultimate endlinehere  we never knew blank verse could have such feet endlinehere  where is it now endlinehere  oh more than ever now i sometimes think no poetry is read save where some sepultured caesura bled royally incarnadining all the line endlinehere  is the imperial iamb laid to rest and the young trochee having done enough

sunk to the sheer hell of pain but its not going to happen again my boy its not going to happen again endlinehere  all in the town were still asleep when the sun came up with a shout and a leap endlinehere  in the lonely streets unseen by man a little dog danced endlinehere  and the day began endlinehere  all his life hed been good as far as he could and the poor little beast had done all that he should endlinehere  but this morning he swore by odin and thor and the canine valhalla hed stand it no more endlinehere  so his prayer he got granted to do just what he wanted prevented by none for the space of one day endlinehere  he fought with the he dogs and winked at the she dogs a thing that had never been heard of before endlinehere  for the stigma of gluttony i care not a button endlinehere  he cried and ate all he could swallow and more endlinehere  he took sinewy lumps from the shins of old frumps and mangled the errand boys when he could get em endlinehere  he shammed furious rabies and bit all the babies and followed the cats up the trees and then ate em endlinehere  when the blood red sun had gone burning down and the lights were lit in the little town outside in the gloom of the twilight grey the little dog died when hed had his day endlinehere  unstumbling unreluctant strong unknowing borne by a will not his that lifts that grows sweeps out to darkness triumphing in his goal out of the fire out of the little room endlinehere  i only know that as he turned to go and waved his hand in his young eyes a sudden glory shone and i was dazzled by a sunset glow and he was gone endlinehere  in alien earth across a troubled sea his body lies that was so fair and young endlinehere  his mouth is stopped with half his songs unsung his arm is still that struck to make men free endlinehere  but let no cloud of lamentation be where on a warriors grave a lyre is hung endlinehere  we keep the echoes of his golden tongue we keep the vision of his chivalry endlinehere  so israels joy the loveliest of kings smote now his harp and now the hostile horde endlinehere  to day the starry roof of heaven rings with psalms a soldier made to praise his lord and

called democracy sets every heart and soul forever free an equity not royal grant sets bounds endlinehere  no phaeton attempting phoebus rounds and burning up earths grass and forestry is lust for power tis love for liberty with bloom and birds for wheel sparks here resounds endlinehere  it is the land of spirit endlinehere  ye who enter abandon first all fratricidal hate proclaims the edict blazoned oer each gate endlinehere  there see all tribes chase truth to joy the center convexing broad and broader as more great their numbers from where prejudice is mentor endlinehere  hark tis the

ghastly gory crys out thou yet shall be the fugitive endlinehere  oh weirder grows the whisper into word as sharp as lightening and as broad of reach as seas flung down by god to every beach where thirsts a sparrow or a bleating herd endlinehere  the shouts of millions shake oblivions mire and raise thralls hulks endlinehere  justices stooping sun seeing in agonys each a washington breaths life in them and over brooklyns spire and new yorks babel tower they one by one hold libertys broading torch of quenchless fire endlinehere  hate thou not any man for at the worst he still is brother endlinehere  will a glance not find whole peoples alchemied from heart and mind to steal projectiles by a craft accursed by human nature endlinehere  aye for as they burst at dusk or midnight slamming heaven behind and crashing hell wide open tis mankind is shattered and quick gulping grave slake thirst endlinehere  hate thou no man but scorn all crafts that smelt the heart and mind for huge projectiles shattered when bursting grandly that some pride be flattered endlinehere  nature beholds not saxon slav nor celt she only sees the human fragments scattered and covering them her eyes to rivers melt endlinehere  have i ever been untrue endlinehere  when to thy moan of hunger anywhere have i been deaf endlinehere  was i not quick to share my little nay give all endlinehere  i knew thy beauty and my love such passion grew at thy distresses what would i not dare endlinehere  so though the bellow like a grizzly bear reared up before me on to thee i flew endlinehere  is thy beauty without heart or sense of justice endlinehere  unto whom art thou indebted for thine arm encircling now the world sun like more than to me endlinehere  my part i glory in for i have kept my vow endlinehere  i hold thee now to thine if true thou art endlinehere  when a haggard fugitive thy dwelling was a swamp who first to trace thy crimson footprints to thy hiding place endlinehere  with signs thou hadst not many days to live i found thee endlinehere  had the sun more heart to give to warm thee than i gave endlinehere  ah then and there thy heart said to my heart ill would i fare without thee endlinehere  i give love for love believe endlinehere  thy silence when in glory troubles me endlinehere  warm blood dashed back cold chills to the bone endlinehere  what do i ask for endlinehere  only erins own that which god gave her and if true it be thou art the minister of justice grown thy gratitude should thunder gods decree endlinehere  why bemoan one island in the sea when i can range like mountains or the sun above all clouds and rosy from my run to god like morn chant praise since flesh of thee endlinehere  oh yea my pride and transport verily is thou and i eternally are one and this god passion which no power can stun i owe to her who gave her soul to me endlinehere  tis liberty to whose most blessed birth the stars all lead rejoicing which souls thee with gods compassion for humanity that i invoke and now when all the earth bears palms and chants hosannas what endlinehere  shall she the most devout be shut from freedoms mirth endlinehere  all english glory

it out ye orchestras endlinehere  but oh leave not in doubt its import kipling that tis maelstrom roar tis englands streams of home life world about and down a gulf for greed and pride on shore endlinehere  aye weapons only for to whom belong the minds of england and treed fields of song nay all but grave ground grudged by hill and plain endlinehere  o english people whom the crafty class has huddled into graves from sight and sound of what god hands you and with pence or pound lids down your wild dead stare wake endlinehere  see in the celts spring burst from underground the human

whose history a crater belching black and lurid keeps glad easter morning back from half the world loves thee save to invade as blackward planned endlinehere  loves thee along whose track march human rights up to the stars parade endlinehere  there where the tyrant long has loomed wreck crowned are young and old hurled to the coast and blast endlinehere  frail are their ships still sun why glare aghast watching the billows monstering around endlinehere  the soul of man was not born to be drowned endlinehere  it mounts and mounts till at gods throne at last and freedom welcomes it with arms sky vast as down it comes to meet thrall and confound endlinehere  o deathless spirit born of hosts sea hurled who hast out soared nights stars with agonys cry for justice endlinehere  thou hast come down from the sky heralding doom to thrall whose flag unfurled by steel or craft shows as tis hoisted high the blood of man and ruin of the world endlinehere  what is the truth endlinehere  the thought the act or cry recasting the supreme intelligence all else is false endlinehere  where are stars so dense that each has not the freedom of the sky endlinehere  and still what peace what glory reigns on high endlinehere  with the wisdom of the heavens dispense endlinehere  the peace for which our longings grow intense comes through the stars to earth and but thereby endlinehere  what splits dark mid night and gives earth a thrill endlinehere  all stars merged into one our countrys aim endlinehere  it is a lightening formed by god to flame across the ages and flash bolts to kill the stranglers who the heart or spirit main or choke black in the face a peoples will endlinehere  who is to rise and hurl gods flame world wide as lincoln hurled it setting free a race from sphinx shaped wrong a beast with human face endlinehere  that shattered how our land rose glorified and from the stars last laggard soared their guide endlinehere  oh who can take promethean lincolns place to bring light where so ever he can trace a human with his rights to soul denied endlinehere  he must be one not only to illume all ages and not leave one region dim but at no height allow his senses swim or let mirages lure him with false bloom endlinehere  here one comes with all the virtues prim to hurl gods fire and end all human gloom endlinehere  tis wilson takes gods flame from lincolns hand endlinehere  why not hurl them and convince the world that hence forth not one thrall shall stand endlinehere  wilsons arm lacks strength to hurl the flame god gave to lincoln for the human race endlinehere  quenched by dark space endlinehere  no it describes an orbit there the same as comets and regains its heavenly place for one to hurl it true and doom earths shame endlinehere  in wilson we beheld and proudly hailed the worlds deliverer endlinehere  in him we saw a luminous being rise from earth and draw all lands above the clouds endlinehere  we were regaled with justice cascades flow long ice impaled upon high mountains endlinehere  was not natures thaw from his heart heat for truth eternal law endlinehere  his was the heat of all the stars he scaled endlinehere  though his ascension was like christs sublime with lift of continents and every isle he less than christ succumbed to demon guile endlinehere  oh god that he should drop his mountain climb below sea level and let earth the while fall back and settle in primeval slime endlinehere  oh such his truth to god so oft avowed a spirit thundred from a luminous cloud this man crowns lincolns work endlinehere  oh had he read his bible where st endlinehere  paul grown man put off child things or had not smiled when told strong ego oft is man grown child endlinehere  who sees not an epochs angel fall from hope for earth in wilsons truth beguiled by second childhoods toys to play with thrall endlinehere  our country still is in the womb dark time endlinehere  it shows life by its brisk and robust turns which thrill the mother liberty who yearns to see her man child born endlinehere  oh how sublime with genius not of one but every climb where art forms beauty or the spirit spurns the foul and spurious her desire that burns prenatally in him to form him prime endlinehere  oh people all italian spanish french dutch english irish german jew and greek what see you as you climb the futures peak endlinehere  what looms there shall wrench from life all monsters out from hell to seek dead consciences and plague earth with their stench endlinehere  ascend o land of every creed and race endlinehere  not thy full image in new englands brook nor in the souths lagoon though there a look delights us with thy chubby infant face endlinehere  tis seas of joy that shorelessly replace the ocean which in time of old forsook the prairies for the cloud or spring in nook that show thee grown through gods abundant grace endlinehere  behold two fleets the one with woe for trail the other rapture endlinehere  as they sight the strait through which but one can pass greed urged by hate drives thraldoms crafts with help of steam and gale endlinehere  they feel their way endlinehere  the guns with which they hale raise jets that look tall elms from hope the gate to peace the palace then their speed is great manoeuvering fast to head off or assail endlinehere  drawing the sea up for his driving steam greed breaks all mirrors in his grand state room that show him dark inevitable doom close hovering and exults i am supreme endlinehere  when seas lack water for my funnel fume i bid life send its every crimson stream endlinehere  in the darkness lowers boat after boat from freedoms fleet and each with lightening oars endlinehere  treasons to god and country are the rowers endlinehere  they are the gold and hireling brain that gloat on conscience body with face down afloat endlinehere  why hail they greed to run on menial chores from deck to deck or to and from all shores endlinehere  to ensure the payment of a note endlinehere  meanwhile brisk freedoms fleets with justice manned and cosmic full momentum for their speed confront the crafts fired up by fiendish greed endlinehere  a clash and lo endlinehere  they pass the strait and land leaving in smoldering heaps like autumns weed the hulks of thrall along times vultured strand endlinehere  are lust for gold and power not hideous spawn of prehistoric reptiles that had wings endlinehere  where eer those crawled they chawed all greening things and when they mounted how their lengths full drawn basked barren in the sun before the dawn absorbing all its rays from budding springs endlinehere  these drain lifes dawn and by impoverishings draw and reduce to pulp frail consciences endlinehere  oh yea bewinged with legislative crime they bask in sunlight eer the east sky greys and drag the soul of man from gods embrace of rights and freedom endlinehere  oh how long a time shall reptiles deadly to the human race be let grow wings and heavenward trail their slime endlinehere  what though fine graphic sketches in magazines show them with shoulders bold against the nights flood gates of dark and cold endlinehere  all effort is but life in death throw stretches endlinehere  o heart and brain who see the father load his train with food not for the few but all and hear train whistlings in march winds jay call and ground hog sniffs endlinehere  o heart and brain it rest with you how long the legislative wreckers shall prevail endlinehere  ye have the power to balk them endlinehere  regain your legislatures endlinehere  man them strong and drive thence all sleek hounds trust trained to trail safe outlaws paths to fastnesses of wrong endlinehere  was ever such unblushing harlotry such sale of virtue in the market place as by the press endlinehere  the red paint on her face is degradations mark endlinehere  alas that she born to bring forth the truth still is so base she kills her child and then to hide all trace cracks bone by bone to dust too fine to see endlinehere  o press poor harlot of the tyrant gold what freedom but from truth hast thou to boast endlinehere  hark who now speaks is murdered truths pale ghost conceiving life oh bring it forth endlinehere  aye hold thy child on high with love as priest the host endlinehere  crush not its bones with smile and eyes set cold endlinehere  the focus of all rays passing through nature and the soul and mind endlinehere  it is the sun of suns around which wind the heavens and all the worlds endlinehere  such is its blaze that had it not at intervals a haze grading both angel and the human kind the bright arch angel would be stricken blind to grope in heaven a homer sighing lays endlinehere  what less could fitly crown omnipotence than truth the focus of all rays in good endlinehere  there it shines upon the holy rood breaking through clouds a massing dark and dense from countless ages cains to brotherhood with rays of pardon for the worlds offense endlinehere  they know not what they do endlinehere  all grandeurs gathered as a dazzling crown for thee in barter for thy knees least bend the demon dashed to fragments to times end endlinehere  there born anew in spirit we look down and in the ocean of thy prayer amend see but earths monsters with the demons drown endlinehere  thought is truths echo not her glorious eyes beholding god nor her white arms of light lifted in worship endlinehere  following truth our flight at highest range is where our echo dies endlinehere  oh all your power and beauty earth and skys endlinehere  and soul and mind endlinehere  your beauty and your might truth gathers in one flash and catching sight of god lifts high in loves full sacrifice endlinehere  twixt truth and thought what truth is oft is space wherein with intuition for her wing the soul mounts endlinehere  it is there i hear her sing lo truth so swift aloft thought dies in chase turns earthward and the gifts her white arms bring are outshone by gods glory in her face endlinehere  ah what is heaven endlinehere  such glory that sun light seems darkness and mass music shell shut sound endlinehere  what we call senses here there so abound the soul appears a broadening heaven in flight feathered and downed with all the stars whose white is all hues mingled endlinehere  oh the awe profound endlinehere  for every moment there new heavens astound the myriad senses with gods love and might endlinehere  if holy holy holy evermore endlinehere  was not humility the earthward stair from highest heaven by which god came to men to show the way aloft to human ken endlinehere  ah by what other pass are men to fare through mist and cloud except the path aflare with his blest steps from heaven and up again endlinehere  steps not from star to star but fen to fen that all might follow and not one despair endlinehere  oh steps of love endlinehere  could we reach with our eyes their fulgence we would shrink back with dismay for though tis through the worlds contempt move they hark endlinehere  how the hidden choirs of countless skies chant at all heights lo god comes by this way and makes world wide his stair to paradise endlinehere  oh cataracts beyond the angels count pause and shine pendant over every deep of heart mind spirit endlinehere  how down they sweep to basic good where massing they remount till mid gods many mansions high they leap forming forever joys most splendent fount endlinehere  when at gods fiat light flashed forth the beam evolved a million pigments as it sped to every nature endlinehere  for harboring meaner thought were to blaspheme endlinehere  what if the world be chaos where it sins race feuds creed hatreds falsehoods gross deceit intrigue and greed form swirling blinding sleet endlinehere  honor and truth though buried to their chins look up and smile for though the storms still beat the poets show tis spring not winter wins endlinehere  not mine the night that creeps beneath lifes sea or lurks within hopes ruins sunk below the desert or the stagnant pool oh no endlinehere  oh once the cold of all the unsunnd space was in my reptile life of soul wing bound but now soul free what warmth from stars all round endlinehere  tis not by strength of mine lord but thy grace my soul soars from the depths of sea or ground till at star heights it meets thee face to face endlinehere  what but the spirits ladder to gods throne is beauty endlinehere  ah there what joy my prize endlinehere  would that i had a dove for every boon endlinehere  the sun is gods great joy to human sight endlinehere  oh up and off in chariots sea endlinehere  and ride all generations up till mountain eyed to welcome earth ward gods supreme delight endlinehere  imagination swirls in swallow flight giddy with beauty deepening oh how glide from star to star to the haloes season dyed and countless endlinehere  its wings shrivel up like night endlinehere  oh yea the sun in one subliming rise from wisdoms infinite mind endlinehere  this reason knows endlinehere  it has no set endlinehere  there sense with weals or woes for beads or fingers count our shuts of eyes excluding knowledge endlinehere  gods joy to close and all its goodness break and drift cloud wise endlinehere  there are two darknesses one where the lord hides beauty that by which men know his face endlinehere  all in that darkness feel his fingers trace their features gently and their hearts record the feeling as of one whose eyes restored would see but for the fathers close embrace endlinehere  the other is the outer dark a place where hate turns black the light upon it poured endlinehere  a spirit passed the sun the moon and star and dwelled and dreamed in darkness all its own endlinehere  ah if where love was not he smiled elate his smile at god returned a lightening flash that shattered him endlinehere  he saw his planets clash burst and then by the downward law of hate sink and leave not a single spark nor ash for the new firmament he would create endlinehere  there are two gods one good the other ill endlinehere  they clash in nature so the persian taught and long a sect in europe spread the thought endlinehere  god said let there be light and light was made endlinehere  god made not darkness that is lights exclusion forming a region where in wild confusion men nations each a ferret blood eyed shade worry each other till with disillusion for lamp comes conscience crying god betrayed endlinehere  ah in the angel fall from heaven is hope endlinehere  the wing whir discord of the legions fall from god forever mocks my hearts loud call endlinehere  empty of beauty from its base to cope the earth is hollow endlinehere  where then can i grope and not be met by echoes that appal endlinehere  shouts my mind in wonder that i crawl and having skyey wings in hollows mope endlinehere  does scent from bloom or warble from the wood not atmosphere the un aerial void twixt thee and beauty which thy youth enjoyed endlinehere  fly back to earth by memory renewed she fills the hollow echoing hosts destroyed with spring reflecting heavens triumphant good endlinehere  in the dimple of thy cheek my love could live forever and be blest endlinehere  there with the sun a rose bud on thy breast how thou rejoicest hastening to speak to thy fond father endlinehere  oh how vain to seek a sweeter refuge for the spirits rest than mid thy blushes when thou marvelest at his great love for oh endlinehere  thy heart is meek endlinehere  in thy fathers arms thou art endlinehere  beauty is love and hence is heightening fire consuming nature endlinehere  all the dark can bring to quench it feeds it endlinehere  how everything is caught in the blaze which mounts up high and higher endlinehere  truly tis a vision to inspire the soul with transport more than joy can sing for if not for the blaze what cold would sting poor mortals who crowd round it nigh and nigher endlinehere  is beauty not the camp fire which one host leaves burning for another close behind endlinehere  yea yea the powers divine o human kind endlinehere  have left their camp fire burning on the coast where they embarked from glimpse of human mind to give you warmth and light to hold your post endlinehere  all beings legioning celestial light moved in procession toward a vacant throne endlinehere  their chant was faith and hope as now our own endlinehere  at last it came to pass their faith grew sight endlinehere  they saw one star in nights down fall stay white and by the holy spirit brighter blown ascend in heaven till there as high and lone as over natures marveling zenith height endlinehere  reaching the throne its queen this star became endlinehere  god lets drop blue doves which ground the mind like clover then with drawing to the skies his pleasure is to watch the flocks arise endlinehere  oh to his love how great our spirits worth endlinehere  each is as all endlinehere  in heaven no heart still heaves endlinehere  this temple is soul startling endlinehere  tis to me a thunder storm in stone with sinai flare across the ages endlinehere  tis the fiends despair and the arch angels triumph endlinehere  it sets free the mind and soul with certitude christs key which like the sun opes heaven the good and fair endlinehere  still oft what darkness drowns the suns noon glare within the temple endlinehere  tis from calvary endlinehere  oh tis from calvarys grief endlinehere  with heart pain and with quiver of the lip i bid my boy good bye with words of cheer endlinehere  i hug him to my heart to hide a tear and hold him close so long that no tongue slip could more betray my bodings for his ship or troop when landed endlinehere  it is when i hear my daughters voices that i shame off fear and take my boys both hands with firmest grip endlinehere  dost thou mad kaiser for historic name set fire to europe endlinehere  o twin of chaos endlinehere  peer thou through the haze endlinehere  tis human beings feed the crackling flame endlinehere  beware the smoke like etnas is the curse of widows on thy people dooming throne and in no country more than in thine own cry out all mothers wherefore bear and nurse endlinehere  to feed war with our sons our flesh and bone that chaos may reclaim the universe endlinehere  the german mother has too long been what a chancellor once called the kingdoms cow endlinehere  ah as she bears the droves for slaughter how her dumb beast eyes crave pity for her lot endlinehere  see there she smiles like loving god forgot all his supernal patience on her brow endlinehere  how long must her grand arch of brain as now bear up a universe of what should not endlinehere  there lies she crushed by troops in hot pursuit of mocking shadows for be gain complete what is it but twin brother to defeat endlinehere  stand up the dead on any bloody route endlinehere  stoop for no kiss from orphans at thy feet o triumph endlinehere  for ash cord is all thy fruit endlinehere  o fair full moon endlinehere  i look close at thy face endlinehere  thou must be happy being in the skys and yet thy flush grows pallor to mine eyes endlinehere  thou art as one who breathless after chase would rest but dreads to check her onward pace endlinehere  o fugitive from where no fledgling flies no bee finds bud and where red billows rise engulfing down dark years the human race endlinehere  o thou pale moon who hast companioned man through every darkness since the nights first fall endlinehere  how glares the tiger in his desert lair now half the world endlinehere  beholding with dismay that human freedom is the tigers prey a giant down whose shoulders broad and bare the long thick crimson flow is sampsons hair makes haste to clutch the beast endlinehere  oh how the clay beneath their struggle reddens night and day till lies the beast a shapeless carcass there endlinehere  where flies our flag is freedoms holy ground there it unfurls all benisons to man endlinehere  the twin of spring its spread unfolds gods plan of human happiness by setting bound to greed lust powers all colds that right be crowned endlinehere  where it leads ye youth form valors van mirrored and echoed by the azures span for ages for mans gain in yours is wound endlinehere  oh justices hot gulf stream are ye who open the sea which fiendish craft has frozen hard endlinehere  oh may your warmth for righteousness transform the tyrants artic region with no hope in to freedoms temperate zone which they who guard the planets save from wreck by quake or storm endlinehere  now and in life not virgil breaks a storm of harpies harsh to ear and foul to smell endlinehere  it sweeps wars lengthening coast where each sea swell is humans gasping endlinehere  tis the laughter of the stars at earth and natures too with every pitch of voice endlinehere  earths carnival of sheer grotesque and noise where gagged and manacled walk peace and mirth shows britain now a beast of broadening girth set out to crush world freedom endlinehere  he destroys and thinks his bear like rearing planet poise that is to influence the worlds new birth endlinehere  that is why the stars laugh and all nature jeers the show endlinehere  lord not thy work the worlds calamities but mans endlinehere  there the brine is anguish and there triumph leaves no sign save wreck on rock and plague adrift on breeze endlinehere  when nations turn from light in thought or life their speed is brink ward save thy mercy stay for all is precipice except thy way endlinehere  help lord for here is heightening surge of strife here clouds turn floods coasts are wind whirled like spray and lightenings hurling back thy light are rife endlinehere  religion is ascension endlinehere  tis the flights of souls to summits of the true and wise endlinehere  one witnessing the generations rise sees them a shine at countless different heights where they responding to their inner lights glow like the clouds at morn with graded dyes endlinehere  if summits there are depths if virtue vice hence tis lifes rise from falls that judgment sights endlinehere  how thy half century shines over head endlinehere  tis an unfading rain bow one whose dyes are richer and more numerous to the eyes of angels than to ours endlinehere  its rays if spread above a flood of sin and world of dead give to the drowned new life new earth new skies endlinehere  night counts her stars but falters when souls rise bright with the grace which gods annointed shed endlinehere  belovd irene how great our joy to see thine arch aglow with virtues every hue endlinehere  oh how much more must they rejoice who view from inner heaven the arch that is for thee triumphal endlinehere  for than vows like thine lived true no grander arch from earth to heaven could be endlinehere  the church triumphant shines in lives like thine calista endlinehere  tis the saints procession shown in dantes vision near lord jesus throne in greatening splendor never to decline endlinehere  ah if our minds grow dark our hearts repine how from sweet lives dear sister like thine own be mothering with mercy all who moan a light comes and a warmth is in its shine endlinehere  we shade our eyes as when we face the sun on level with the earth at lives all love the church triumphant as in heaven above endlinehere  aye lives all love for christ in every one who suffers wrong or any pain thereof as on his throne such lives as thine dear nun endlinehere  once blindness was a burning ship at sea with panic stricken souls on every deck endlinehere  the flame blew inward on that awful wreck burning the hopes that make life glad and free endlinehere  then through thee it was philanthropy who trains her searchlight on the smallest speck and speed out boats like horses neck to neck reached the dark hulk and thrilled its crew with glee endlinehere  the flame is quenched that burned out heart and brain endlinehere  the ship where woe was mute is loud with joy endlinehere  hear the cheer on board and cry ahoy endlinehere  as fast the sails are hoisted and the main tides back toward hope for every girl and boy who else might reach no star of nights whole train endlinehere  above and under life eternally a subtle light and dark run parallel endlinehere  one prompts men to build beauty cell by cell in home religion state society the other to destroy the fair they see endlinehere  like spring wilt thou roof earth with bloom and dwell thereunder endlinehere  or with scalping winters yell scour grove and bush endlinehere  choose how else art thou free endlinehere  if freedom is the gift of the all wise it is because he will not have a slave to serve him endlinehere  which wilt thou be base or brave endlinehere  with morn climb or with night skulk down the skies to grope in caverns or beneath the wave creep till aghast at monsters that arise endlinehere  the stars that calm the sailor long sea swirled and canopy fond lovers from the world and those that lead the heart and spirit blend endlinehere  lo only in the things and thoughts that tend toward loves high harmony is truth unfurled all else are lies whence heart soul mind are hurled back to the right to progress without end endlinehere  the stars all chant as one endlinehere  from out the depths thy coast was lifted skyward for humanity endlinehere  thy life once finny circlings in the sea is now the orbits of the starry host encircling god with trust endlinehere  be this thy boast when the long line of ages passing thee lifts each his heart and soul and shouts with glee that trust in him was sentinel on post endlinehere  on toward the senate scuds a thunder rack nay cyclone and the columns all star straight of freedoms temple sway with the roofs flood weight endlinehere  ye stalwarts who scorn off a fate pitch black holding the columns let no sinew slack endlinehere  a crash and through the roof what floods of hate endlinehere  still ye budge not for freedom your teeth grate shall lie no wreck along the cyclones track endlinehere  oh not for you was dark the time to slumber but to hold freedoms columns all star plumb endlinehere  yours was a watery grave but martyrdom and hence your resurrection with the number whose greatness greatens as the ages come to know why their pathway no wrecks encumber endlinehere  o bastile builder endlinehere  deliver thee who put on freedoms back wouldst grab all things at which thy past eyes gaped endlinehere  freedom would humor thee so down he flopped on justices floor to watch thee build with blocks endlinehere  o harvard of the norton wreath of gold and pearled longfellow purple endlinehere  if eliott is a speck upon your gown it will wash off it is no stain to hold for you had let him go for being old endlinehere  your wisdom was confirmed when to the crown against good folks who like elisha brown fought for their homes he gave his names renown endlinehere  for from the smallest bone you reconstruct the creature tongue to tail endlinehere  tell us what eliott is endlinehere  no tis the prehistoric monster known as tory that devoured young nathan hale and where it crawled spread horrors crimson zone endlinehere  your heart is not a traitor to your mind endlinehere  who knowing innocence in danger dares not turn his eye for fear of smirk or stares by other courts is justices statue blind that to the wall not bench should be assigned endlinehere  oft precedent is folly with gray hairs so you recalling junius heard the prayers of friendless stilow then what did you find endlinehere  a fellow man doomed wrongfully to die a felons death endlinehere  if such was stilows fate you saw the felon would have been the state hence turned from precedent demanding why endlinehere  justice asleep in marble woke and straight unroofed the courthouse to let down the sky endlinehere  a dukedom and not one the worse for wear has sims well earned by service to the king endlinehere  the eagle with his eye and pinion trained for mateship with the sun twitched at a sting endlinehere  amazed to find a cootie on his wing and that the insect dreamed it was ordained by race heredity to serve the king he shook his plume and azured unprofained endlinehere  in english nature did saint george prevail over the dragon endlinehere  maybe in the time when england knew not poverty nor crime described by cobbett who would not go bail for falsehood nor let truth remain in jail endlinehere  it must then have renewed life from its slime for oh endlinehere  through deeds that turn the blood to chyme and eyes white inward see him ride the gale endlinehere  in english nature oh where now the saint the spirit to sublime conceptions true endlinehere  has good saint george too woundful to renew his conflict with the dragon of base taint been caught up by elias from earths view endlinehere  how else the dragons rage in irrestraint endlinehere  the dragon is grim greed endlinehere  the saints long spear that once transfixed it can no longer touch endlinehere  the dragons soarings cause the suns eclypse endlinehere  is that thunder gods collapsing skys endlinehere  a conflict this refracted cloud to cloud endlinehere  where a white summit endlinehere  under crimson seas and these still hightening endlinehere  through far azure peace listens and eager peeps then turns headbowed endlinehere  the conflict circling earth all plains are ploughed new rows of gulches endlinehere  can aught appease the dragon with fiend thirsts eternities for tongue endlinehere  the sun might if it were well sloughed endlinehere  the dragon mounting draws aloft earths slime with which to dim the all producing sun from broadening light and warmth for every one but look endlinehere  the eagle with the thirst sublime of justice that the right on earth be done flashes and hark endlinehere  tis earths te deum chime endlinehere  the grace to soul to scorn to be mere thing endlinehere  i cried and they answered me endlinehere  what sayest thou oh meadow that stretches so wide so far that none can say how many thy misty marguerites are endlinehere  and what say ye red roses that oer the sun blanched wall from your high black shadowed trellis like flame or blood drops fall endlinehere  we are born we are reared and we linger a various space and die we dream and are bright and happy but we cannot answer why endlinehere  what sayest thou oh shadow that from the dreaming hill all down the broadening valley liest so sharp and still endlinehere  we are born we are reared and we linger a various space and die we dream and are very happy but we cannot answer why endlinehere  may thy passing joyous be to thy father the great sea for the sun is getting stronger earth hath need of thee no longer go kind snow god speed to thee endlinehere  i break the spirits cloudy bands a wanderer in enchanted lands i feel the sun upon my hands and far from care and strife the broad earth bids me forth endlinehere  i rise with lifted brow and upward eyes endlinehere  i bathe my spirit in blue skies and taste the springs of life endlinehere  there is singing of birds in the deep wet woods in the heart of the listening solitudes pewees and thrushes and sparrows not few and all the notes of their throats are true endlinehere  the thrush from the innermost ash takes on a tender dream of the treasured and gone but the sparrow singeth with pride and cheer of the might and light of the present and here endlinehere  there is shining of flowers in the deep wet woods in the heart of the sensitive solitudes the roseate bell and the lily are there and every leaf of their sheaf is fair endlinehere  careless and bold without dream of woe the trilliums scatter their flags snow but the pale wood daffodil covers her face agloom with the doom of a sorrowful race endlinehere  the vesper sparrows song the stress of yearning notes that gush and stream the lyric joy the tenderness and once again the dream endlinehere  a touch of far off joy and power a something it is life to learn comes back to earth and one short hour the glamours of the gods return endlinehere  this lifes old mood and cult of care falls smitten by an older truth and the gray world wins back to her the rapture of her vanished youth endlinehere  dead thoughts revive and he that heeds shall hear as by a spirit led a song among the golden reeds the gods are vanished but not dead endlinehere  for one short hour unseen yet near they haunt us a forgotten mood a glory upon mead and mere a magic in the leafless wood endlinehere  at morning we shall catch the glow of dians quiver on the hill and somewhere in the glades i know that pan is at his piping still endlinehere  now though no more by marsh or stream or dewy forest sounds the secret reed for pan is gone ah yet the infinite dream still lives for them that heed endlinehere  an old world joyousness supreme the warmth and glow of an immortal balm the mood touch of the gods the endless dream the high lethean calm endlinehere  they see wide on the eternal way the services of earth the life of man and listening to the magic cry they say it is the note of pan endlinehere  here the slim pinioned swallows sweep and pass down to the far off river the black crow with wise and wary visage to and fro settles and stalks about the withered grass endlinehere  here too the robins lusty as of old hunt the waste grass for forage or prolong from every quarter of these fields the bold blithe phrases of their never finished song endlinehere  the white throats distant descant with slow stress note after note upon the noonday falls filling the leisured air at intervals with his own mood of piercing pensiveness endlinehere  grief was my master yesternight to morrow i may grieve again but now along the windy plain the clouds have taken flight endlinehere  the roads far off are towered with dust the cherry blooms are swept and thinned in yonder swaying elms the wind is charging gust on gust endlinehere  but here there is no stir at all the ministers of sun and shadow horde all the perfumes of the meadow behind a grassy wall endlinehere  an infant rivulet wind free adown the guarded hollow sets over whose brink the violets are nodding peacefully endlinehere  from pool to pool it prattles by the flashing swallows dip and pass above the tufted marish grass and here at rest am i endlinehere  i care not for the old distress nor if to morrow bid me moan to day is mine and i have known an hour of blessedness endlinehere  i passed through the gates of the city the streets were strange and still through the doors of the open churches the organs were moaning shrill endlinehere  i strayed through the midst of the city like one distracted or mad endlinehere  i kept saying and the very word seemed sad endlinehere  i passed through the gates of the city and i heard the small birds sing i laid me down in the meadows afar from the bell ringing endlinehere  in the depth and the bloom of the meadows i lay on the earths quiet breast the poplar fanned me with shadows and the veery sang me to rest endlinehere  blue blue was the heaven above me and the earth green at my feet oh life endlinehere  i kept saying and the very word seemed sweet endlinehere  high in the hills the solitary thrush tunes magically his music of fine dreams in briary dells by boulder broken streams and wide and far on nebulous fields aflush the mellow morning gleams endlinehere  the orange cone flowers purple bossed are there the meadows bold eyed gypsies deep of hue and slender hawkweed tall and softly fair and rosy tops of fleabane veiled with dew endlinehere  dim surging motions and uneasy dreads scare the light slumber from mens busy eyes and parted lovers on their restless beds toss and yearn out and cannot sleep for sighs endlinehere  ah the distance endlinehere  blue and broad and dim endlinehere  peace is not in burgh or meadow but beyond the rim endlinehere  aye beyond it far beyond it follow still my soul till this earth is lost in heaven and thou feelst the whole endlinehere  and yet a moment more out of the silent wood as if from the closing door of another world and another lovelier mood hearst thou the hermit pour so sweet endlinehere  his golden music ghostly beautiful endlinehere  but when the fourth day came at noon the darkness and the rain were by the sunward roofs were steaming dry and all the world was flecked and strewn with shadows from a fleecy sky endlinehere  the haymakers were forth and gone and every rillet laughed and shone endlinehere  with a turn of his magical rod that extended and suddenly shone from the round of his glory some god looks forth and is gone endlinehere  to the summit of heaven the clouds are rolling aloft like steam theres a break in their infinite shrouds and below it a gleam endlinehere  oer the drift of the river a whiff comes out from the blossoming shore and the meadows are greening as if they never were green before endlinehere  the islands are kindled with gold and russet and emerald dye and the interval waters outrolled are more blue than the sky endlinehere  from my feet to the heart of the hills the spirits of may intervene and a vapor of azure distills like a breath on the opaline green endlinehere  and then the chill and the shadow decline on the eyes of rejuvenate men that were wide and divine endlinehere  the full clear moon uprose and spread her cold pale splendor oer the sea a light strewn path that seemed to lead outward into eternity endlinehere  between the darkness and the gleam an old world spell encompassed me methought that in a godlike dream i trod upon the sea endlinehere  what wouldst thou have for easement after grief when the rude world hath used thee with despite and care sits at thine elbow day and night filching thy pleasures like a subtle thief endlinehere  on such a day the shrunken stream spends its last water and runs dry clouds like far turrets in a dream stand baseless in the burning sky endlinehere  on such a day at every rod the toilers in the hay field halt with dripping brows and the parched sod yields to the crushing foot like salt endlinehere  i watch the swinging currents go far down to where enclosed and piled the logs crowd and the gatineau comes rushing from the northern wild endlinehere  i see the long low point where close the shore lines and the waters end i watch the barges pass in rows that vanish at the tapering bend endlinehere  i see no more the barges pass nor mark the ripple round the pier and all the uproar mass on mass falls dead upon a vacant ear endlinehere  beyond the tumult of the mills and all the citys sound and strife beyond the waste beyond the hills i look far out and dream of life endlinehere  around the long low shanties whose rough lines break the sealed dreams of many an unnamed lake already in the frost clear morns awake the crash and thunder of the falling pines endlinehere  with what doubting eyes oh sparrow thou regardest me underneath yon spray of yarrow dipping cautiously endlinehere  fear me not oh little sparrow bathe and never fear for to me both pool and yarrow and thyself are dear endlinehere  and on beside the rivers sober edge a long fresh field lies black endlinehere  beyond low thickets gray and reddish stand stroked white with birch and near at hand over a little steel smooth pond hang multitudes of thin and withering sedge endlinehere  across a waste and solitary rise a ploughman urges his dull team a stooped gray figure with prone brow that plunges bending to the plough with strong uneven steps endlinehere  the stream rings and re echoes with his furious cries endlinehere  sometimes the lowing of a cow long drawn comes from far off and crows in strings pass on the upper silences endlinehere  a flock of small gray goldfinches flown down with silvery twitterings rustle among the birch cones and are gone endlinehere  it was a bleak and sandy spot and all about the vacant plot was peopled and inhabited by scores of mulleins long since dead endlinehere  there was no sound about the wood save the winds secret stir endlinehere  i stood among the mullein stalks as still as if myself had grown to be one of their sombre company a body without wish or will endlinehere  now overhead where the rivulet loiters and stops the bittersweet hangs from the tops of the alders and cherries its bunches of beautiful berries orange and red endlinehere  and the snowbirds flee tossing up on the far brown field now flashing and now concealed like fringes of spray that vanish and gleam on the gray field of the sea endlinehere  flickering light come the last of the leaves down borne and patches of pale white corn in the wind complain like the slow rustle of rain noticed by night endlinehere  withered and thinned the sentinel mullein looms with the pale gray shadowy plumes of the goldenrod and the milkweed opens its pod tempting the wind endlinehere  aloft on the hill a cloudrift opens and shines through a break in its gorget of pines and it dreams at my feet in a sad silvery sheet utterly still endlinehere  all things that be seem plunged into silence distraught by some stern some necessitous thought it wraps and enthralls marsh meadow and forest and falls also on me endlinehere  along the narrow sandy height i watch them swiftly come and go or round the leafless wood like flurries of wind driven snow revolving in perpetual flight a changing multitude endlinehere  white are the far off plains and white the fading forests grow the wind dies out along the height and denser still the snow a gathering weight on roof and tree falls down scarce audibly endlinehere  the road before me smooths and fills apace and all about the fences dwindle and the hills are blotted slowly out the naked trees loom spectrally into the dim white sky endlinehere  the meadows and far sheeted streams lie still without a sound like some soft minister of dreams the snow fall hoods me round in wood and water earth and air a silence everywhere endlinehere  the evening deepens and the gray folds closer earth and sky the world seems shrouded far away its noises sleep and i as secret as yon buried stream plod dumbly on and dream endlinehere  from this windy bridge at rest in some former curious hour we have watched the citys hue all along the orange west cupola and pointed tower darken into solid blue endlinehere  subtly conscious all awake let us clear our eyes and break through the cloudy chrysalis see the wonder as it is endlinehere  creeping by the sullen wall we forego the power to see the threads that bind us to the all god or the immensity whereof on the eternal road man is but a passing mode endlinehere  up the fielded slopes at morn where light wefts of shadow pass films upon the bending corn i shall sweep the purple grass endlinehere  sun crowned heights and mossy woods and the outer solitudes mountain valleys dim with pine shall be home and haunt of mine endlinehere  i shall search in crannied hollows where the sunlight scarcely follows and the secret forest brook murmurs and from nook to nook forever downward curls and cools frothing in the bouldered pools endlinehere  i shall stray by many a stream where the half shut lilies gleam endlinehere  napping out the sultry days in the quiet secluded bays where the tasseled rushes tower oer the purple pickerel flower endlinehere  i shall hear the grasshoppers from the parched grass rehearse and with drowsy note prolong evermore the same thin song endlinehere  i shall hear the crickets tell stories by the humming well and mark the locust with quaint eyes caper in his cloak of gray like a jester in disguise rattling by the dusty way endlinehere  i shall dream by upland fences where the seasons wealth condenses over many a weedy wreck wild uncared for desert places that sovereign beauty loves to deck with her softest dearest graces endlinehere  there the long year dreams in quiet and the summers strength runs riot endlinehere  shall i not remember these deep in winter reveries endlinehere  it holds me fast endlinehere  a drifting april twilight sky a wind which blew the puddles dry and slapped the river into waves that ran and hid among the staves of an old wharf endlinehere  a watery light touched bleak the granite bridge and white without the slightest tinge of gold the city shivered in the cold endlinehere  all day my thoughts had lain as dead unborn and bursting in my head endlinehere  from time to time i wrote a word which lines and circles overscored endlinehere  my table seemed a graveyard full of coffins waiting burial endlinehere  i seized these vile abortions tore them into jagged bits and swore to be the dupe of hope no more endlinehere  into the evening straight i went starved of a days accomplishment endlinehere  unnoticing i wandered where the city gave a space for air and on the bridges parapet i leant while pallidly there set a dim discouraged worn out sun endlinehere  behind me where the tramways run blossomed bright lights i turned to leave when someone plucked me by the sleeve endlinehere  your pardon sir but i should be most grateful could you lend to me a carfare i have lost my purse endlinehere  the voice was clear concise and terse endlinehere  i turned and met the quiet gaze of strange eyes flashing through the haze endlinehere  like some spanish don conferring favours even when asking an alms he bowed again and waited endlinehere  but my pockets proved empty in vain i poked and shoved no hidden penny lurking there greeted my search endlinehere  sir i declare i have no money pray forgive but let me take you where you live endlinehere  and so we plodded through the mire where street lamps cast a wavering fire endlinehere  i took no note of where we went his talk became the element wherein my being swam content endlinehere  it flashed like rapiers in the night lit by uncertain candle light when on some moon forsaken sward a quarrel dies upon a sword endlinehere  it hacked and carved like a cutlass blade and the noise in the air the broad words made was the cry of the wind at a window pane on an autumn night of sobbing rain endlinehere  i walked as though some opiate had stung and dulled my brain a state acute and slumbrous endlinehere  we stopped a house stood silent dark endlinehere  from the chimney red eyes sparked the gloom and a crickets chirp filled all the room endlinehere  my host threw pine cones on the fire and crimson and scarlet glowed the pyre wrapped in the golden flames desire endlinehere  the chamber opened like an eye as a half melted cloud in a summer sky the soul of the house stood guessed and shy it peered at the stranger warily endlinehere  a little shop with its various ware spread on shelves with nicest care endlinehere  pitchers and jars and jugs and pots pipkins and mugs and many lots of lacquered canisters black and gold like those in which chinese tea is sold endlinehere  chests and puncheons kegs and flasks goblets chalices firkins and casks endlinehere  in a corner three ancient amphorae leaned against the wall like ships careened endlinehere  there was dusky blue of wedgewood ware the carved white figures fluttering there like leaves adrift upon the air endlinehere  classic in touch but emasculate the greek soul grown effeminate endlinehere  eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt hand on heart and daintily spelt their love in flowers brittle and bright artificial and fragile which told aright the vows of an eighteenth century knight endlinehere  the cruder tones of old dutch jugs glared from one shelf where toby mugs endlessly drank the foaming ale its froth grown dusty awaiting sale endlinehere  ah i see said i you deal in pottery endlinehere  the old man turned and looked at me endlinehere  shook his head gently endlinehere  then from under his cloak he took the thing which i had wondered to see him bring guarded so carefully from sight endlinehere  the old man smiled it has no sheath twas a little careless to have it beneath my cloak for a jostle to my arm would have resulted in serious harm endlinehere  but it was so fine i could not wait so i brought it with me despite its state endlinehere  an amateur of arms i thought bringing home a prize which he has bought endlinehere  you care for this sort of thing dear sir endlinehere  not in the way which you infer endlinehere  i need them in business that is all endlinehere  and he pointed his finger at the wall endlinehere  then i saw what i had not noticed before endlinehere  the walls were hung with at least five score of swords and daggers of every size which nations of militant men could devise endlinehere  poisoned spears from tropic seas that natives under banana trees smear with the juice of some deadly snake endlinehere  blood dipped arrows which savages make and tip with feathers orange and green a quivering death in harlequin sheen endlinehere  high up a fan of glancing steel was formed of claymores in a wheel endlinehere  jewelled swords worn at kings levees were suspended next midshipmens dirks and these elbowed stilettos come from spain chased with some splendid hidalgos name endlinehere  foils with buttons broken or lost lay heaped on a chair among them tossed the boarding pike of a privateer endlinehere  against the chimney leaned a queer two handed weapon with edges dull as though from hacking on a skull endlinehere  the rusted blood corroded it still endlinehere  my host took up a paper spill from a heap which lay in an earthen bowl and lighted it at a burning coal endlinehere  at either end of the table tall wax candles were placed each in a small and slim and burnished candlestick of pewter endlinehere  the old man lit each wick and the room leapt more obviously upon my mind and i could see what the flickering fire had hid from me endlinehere  my head grew dizzy i seemed to hear a battle cry from somewhere near the clash of arms and the squeal of balls and the echoless thud when a dead man falls endlinehere  a smoky cloud had veiled the room shot through with lurid glares the gloom pounded with shouts and dying groans with the drip of blood on cold hard stones endlinehere  sabres and lances in streaks of light gleamed through the smoke and at my right a creese like a licking serpents tongue glittered an instant while it stung endlinehere  streams and points and lines of fire endlinehere  the livid steel which mans desire had forged and welded burned white and cold endlinehere  nerveless and shaking round and round i stared at the walls and at the ground till the room spun like a whipping top and a stern voice in my ear said stop endlinehere  i sell no tools for murderers here endlinehere  of what are you thinking endlinehere  please clear your mind of such imaginings endlinehere  i will tell you of these things endlinehere  he pushed me into a great chair of russet leather poked a flare of tumbling flame with the old long sword up the chimney but said no word endlinehere  slowly he walked to a distant shelf and brought back a crock of finest delf endlinehere  he rested a moment a blue veined hand upon the cover then cut a band of paper pasted neatly round opened and poured endlinehere  a sliding sound came from beneath his old white hands and i saw a little heap of sands black and smooth endlinehere  what could they be pepper i thought endlinehere  he looked at me endlinehere  what you see is poppy seed endlinehere  lethean dreams for those in need endlinehere  he took up the grains with a gentle hand and sifted them slowly like hour glass sand endlinehere  on his old white finger the almandine shot out its rays incarnadine endlinehere  visions for those too tired to sleep endlinehere  these seeds cast a film over eyes which weep endlinehere  no single soul in the world could dwell without these poppy seeds i sell endlinehere  for a moment he played with the shining stuff passing it through his fingers endlinehere  enough at last he poured it back into the china jar of holland blue which he carefully carried to its place endlinehere  then with a smile on his aged face he drew up a chair to the open space twixt table and chimney endlinehere  without preface young man i will say that what you see is not the puzzle you take it to be endlinehere  but surely sir there is something strange in a shop with goods at so wide a range each from the other as swords and seeds endlinehere  your neighbours must have greatly differing needs endlinehere  my neighbours he said and he stroked his chin live everywhere from here to pekin endlinehere  but you are wrong my sort of goods is but one thing in all its moods endlinehere  he took a shagreen letter case from his pocket and with charming grace offered me a printed card endlinehere  i read the legend ephraim bard endlinehere  dealer in words endlinehere  and that was all endlinehere  i stared at the letters whimsical indeed or was it merely a jest endlinehere  he answered my unasked request all books are either dreams or swords you can cut or you can drug with words endlinehere  my firm is a very ancient house the entries on my books would rouse your wonder perhaps incredulity endlinehere  i inherited from an ancestry stretching remotely back and far this business and my clients are as were those of my grandfathers days writers of books and poems and plays endlinehere  my swords are tempered for every speech for fencing wit or to carve a breach through old abuses the world condones endlinehere  these are purchased by men who feel the need of stabbing societys heel which egotism has brought them to think is set on their necks endlinehere  i have foils to pink an adversary to quaint reply and i have customers who buy scalpels with which to dissect the brains and hearts of men endlinehere  ultramundanes even demand some finer kinds to open their own souls and minds endlinehere  but the other half of my business deals with visions and fancies endlinehere  under seals sorted and placed in vessels here i keep the seeds of an atmosphere endlinehere  each jar contains a different kind of poppy seed endlinehere  from farthest ind come the purple flowers opium filled from which the weirdest myths are distilled my orient porcelains contain them all endlinehere  every castle of the air sleeps in the fine black grains and there are seeds for every romance or light whiff of a dream for a summer night endlinehere  i supply to every want and taste endlinehere  twas slowly said in no great haste he seemed to push his wares but i dumfounded listened endlinehere  by and by a log on the fire broke in two endlinehere  he looked up quickly sir and you endlinehere  i groped for something i should say amazement held me numb endlinehere  to day you sweated at a fruitless task endlinehere  he spoke for me what do you ask endlinehere  how can i serve you endlinehere  my kind host my penniless state was not a boast i have no money with me endlinehere  not for that money i beguiled you here you paid me in advance endlinehere  again i felt as though a trance had dimmed my faculties endlinehere  again he spoke and this time to explain endlinehere  the money i demand is life your nervous force your joy your strife endlinehere  what infamous proposal now was made me with so calm a brow endlinehere  bursting through my lethargy indignantly i hurled the cry is this a nightmare or am i drunk with some infernal wine endlinehere  i am no faust and what is mine is what i call my soul endlinehere  devil or ghost endlinehere  your hellish plan revolts me endlinehere  my child and the old tones were very mild i have no wish to barter souls my traffic does not ask such tolls endlinehere  i am no devil is there one endlinehere  surely the age of fear is gone endlinehere  we live within a daylight world lit by the sun where winds unfurled sweep clouds to scatter pattering rain and then blow back the sun again endlinehere  i sell my fancies or my swords to those who care far more for words ideas of which they are the sign than any other life design endlinehere  i claim for all the goods i sell that they will serve their purpose well and though you perish they will live endlinehere  full measure for your pay i give endlinehere  to day you worked you thought in vain endlinehere  what since has happened is the train your toiling brought endlinehere  i spoke to you for my share of the bargain due endlinehere  and is that all you crave in pay endlinehere  what even childhood gave endlinehere  i have been dedicate from youth endlinehere  before my god i speak the truth endlinehere  fatigue excitement of the past few hours broke me down at last endlinehere  all day i had forgot to eat my nerves betrayed me lacking meat endlinehere  i bowed my head and felt the storm plough shattering through my prostrate form endlinehere  the tearless sobs tore at my heart endlinehere  my host withdrew himself apart busied among his crockery he paid no farther heed to me endlinehere  exhausted spent i huddled there within the arms of the old carved chair endlinehere  a long half hour dragged away and then i heard a kind voice say the day will soon be dawning when you must begin to work again endlinehere  here are the things which you require endlinehere  by the fading light of the dying fire and by the guttering candles flare i saw the old man standing there endlinehere  he handed me a packet tied with crimson tape and sealed endlinehere  inside are seeds of many differing flowers to occupy your utmost powers of storied vision and these swords are the finest which my shop affords endlinehere  go home and use them do not spare yourself let that be all your care endlinehere  whatever you have means to buy be very sure i can supply endlinehere  he slowly walked to the window flung it open and in the grey air rung the sound of distant matin bells endlinehere  i took my parcels endlinehere  then as tells an ancient mumbling monk his beads i tried to thank for his courteous deeds my strange old friend endlinehere  nay do not talk he urged me you have a long walk before you endlinehere  and gently sped upon my way i stumbled out in the morning hush as down the empty street a flush ran level from the rising sun endlinehere  another day was just begun endlinehere  over the housetops above the rotating chimney pots i have seen a shiver of amethyst and blue and cinnamon have flickered a moment at the far end of a dusty street endlinehere  through sheeted rain has come a lustre of crimson and i have watched moonbeams hushed by a film of palest green endlinehere  it was her wings goddess endlinehere  who stepped over the clouds and laid her rainbow feathers aslant on the currents of the air endlinehere  i followed her for long with gazing eyes and stumbling feet endlinehere  i followed and watched for the flashing of her wings endlinehere  in the city i found her the narrow streeted city endlinehere  in the market place i came upon her bound and trembling endlinehere  her fluted wings were fastened to her sides with cords she was naked and cold for that day the wind blew without sunshine endlinehere  men chaffered for her they bargained in silver and gold in copper in wheat and called their bids across the market place endlinehere  the tall yellow hollyhocks stand still and straight with their round blossoms spread open in the quiet sunshine endlinehere  and still is the old roman wall rough with jagged bits of flint and jutting stones old and cragged quite still in its antiquity endlinehere  the pear trees press their branches against it and feeling it warm and kindly the little pears ripen to yellow and red endlinehere  they hang heavy bursting with juice against the wall endlinehere  so old so still endlinehere  the sky is still endlinehere  the clouds make no sound as they slide away beyond the cathedral tower to the river and the sea endlinehere  it is very quiet very sunny endlinehere  the myrtle flowers stretch themselves in the sunshine but make no sound endlinehere  the roses push their little tendrils up and climb higher and higher endlinehere  in spots they have climbed over the wall endlinehere  but they are very still they do not seem to move endlinehere  and the old wall carries them without effort and quietly ripens and shields the vines and blossoms endlinehere  a bird in a plane tree sings a few notes cadenced and perfect they weave into the silence endlinehere  the cathedral bell knocks one two three and again and then again endlinehere  it is a quiet sound calling to prayer hardly scattering the stillness only making it close in more densely endlinehere  the gardener picks ripe gooseberries for the deans supper to night endlinehere  it is very quiet very regulated and mellow endlinehere  but the wall is old it has known many days endlinehere  it is a roman wall left over and forgotten endlinehere  beyond the cathedral close yelp and mutter the discontents of people not mellow not well regulated endlinehere  people who care more for bread than for beauty who would break the tombs of saints and give the painted windows of churches to their children for toys endlinehere  people who say they are dead we live endlinehere  the world is for the living endlinehere  it is always the dead who breed endlinehere  crush the ripe fruit and cast it aside yet its seeds shall fructify and trees rise where your huts were standing endlinehere  but the little people are ignorant they chaffer and swarm endlinehere  they gnaw like rats and the foundations of the cathedral are honeycombed endlinehere  the dean is in the chapter house he is reading the architects bill for the completed restoration of the cathedral endlinehere  he will have ripe gooseberries for supper and then he will walk up and down the path by the wall and admire the snapdragons and dahlias thinking how quiet and peaceful the garden is endlinehere  the old wall will watch him very quietly and patiently it will watch endlinehere  for the wall is old it is a roman wall endlinehere  spread on the roadway with open blown jackets like black soaring pinions they swoop down the hillside the cyclists endlinehere  seeming dark plumaged birds after carrion careening and circling over the dying of england endlinehere  she lies with her bosom beneath them no longer the dominant mother the virile but rotting before time endlinehere  the smell of her tainted has bitten their nostrils endlinehere  what charm is yours you faded old world tapestries of outworn childish mysteries vague pageants woven on a web of dream endlinehere  and we pushing and fighting in the turbid stream of modern life find solace in your tarnished broideries endlinehere  old lichened halls sun shaded by huge cedar trees the layered branches horizontal stretched like japanese dark banded prints endlinehere  carven cathedrals on a sky of faintest colour where the gothic spires fly and sway like masts against a shifting breeze endlinehere  worm eaten pages clasped in old brown vellum shrunk from over handling by some anxious monk endlinehere  or virgins hours bright with gold and graven with flowers and rare birds and all the saints of heaven and noahs ark stuck on ararat when all the world had sunk endlinehere  they have watered the street it shines in the glare of lamps cold white lamps and lies like a slow moving river barred with silver and black endlinehere  cabs go down it one and then another endlinehere  between them i hear the shuffling of feet endlinehere  tramps doze on the window ledges night walkers pass along the sidewalks endlinehere  the city is squalid and sinister with the silver barred street in the midst slow moving a river leading nowhere endlinehere  opposite my window the moon cuts clear and round through the plum coloured night endlinehere  she cannot light the city it is too bright endlinehere  it has white lamps and glitters coldly endlinehere  i stand in the window and watch the moon endlinehere  she is thin and lustreless but i love her endlinehere  i know the moon and this is an alien city endlinehere  to ezra pound with much friendship and admiration and some differences of opinion the poet took his walking stick of fine and polished ebony endlinehere  set in the close grained wood were quaint devices patterns in ambers and in the clouded green of jades endlinehere  the top was of smooth yellow ivory and a tassel of tarnished gold hung by a faded cord from a hole pierced in the hard wood circled with silver endlinehere  for years the poet had wrought upon this cane endlinehere  his wealth had gone to enrich it his experiences to pattern it his labour to fashion and burnish it endlinehere  to him it was perfect a work of art and a weapon a delight and a defence endlinehere  the poet took his walking stick and walked abroad endlinehere  peace be with you brother endlinehere  the poet came to a meadow endlinehere  sifted through the grass were daisies open mouthed wondering they gazed at the sun endlinehere  the poet struck them with his cane endlinehere  the little heads flew off and they lay dying open mouthed and wondering on the hard ground endlinehere  they are not roses said the poet endlinehere  the poet came to a stream endlinehere  purple and blue flags waded in the water in among them hopped the speckled frogs the wind slid through them rustling endlinehere  the poet lifted his cane and the iris heads fell into the water endlinehere  they floated away torn and drowning endlinehere  wretched flowers said the poet they are not roses endlinehere  it is your affair endlinehere  the poet came to a garden endlinehere  dahlias ripened against a wall gillyflowers stood up bravely for all their short stature and a trumpet vine covered an arbour with the red and gold of its blossoms endlinehere  red and gold like the brass notes of trumpets endlinehere  the poet knocked off the stiff heads of the dahlias and his cane lopped the gillyflowers at the ground endlinehere  then he severed the trumpet blossoms from their stems endlinehere  red and gold they lay scattered red and gold as on a battle field red and gold prone and dying endlinehere  they were not roses said the poet endlinehere  but behind you is destruction and waste places endlinehere  the poet came home at evening and in the candle light he wiped and polished his cane endlinehere  the orange candle flame leaped in the yellow ambers and made the jades undulate like green pools endlinehere  it played along the bright ebony and glowed in the top of cream coloured ivory endlinehere  but these things were dead only the candle light made them seem to move endlinehere  it is a pity there were no roses said the poet endlinehere  he perches in the slime inert bedaubed with iridescent dirt endlinehere  the ground is here and there bestud with lumps of only part burned coal endlinehere  their sharp and glistening edges cut his stiffened fingers endlinehere  through the smut gleam red the wounds which will not shut endlinehere  wet through and shivering he kneels and digs the slippery coals like eels they slide about endlinehere  his force all spent he counts his small accomplishment endlinehere  a half a dozen clinker coals which still have fire in their souls endlinehere  and in his thought there burns the topaz fire of votive urns endlinehere  he sees it fling from hill to hill and still consumed is burning still endlinehere  higher and higher leaps the flame the smoke an ever shifting frame endlinehere  he sees a spanish castle old with silver steps and paths of gold endlinehere  from myrtle bowers comes the plash of fountains and the emerald flash of parrots in the orange trees whose blossoms pasture humming bees endlinehere  he knows he feeds the urns whose smoke bears visions that his master stroke is out of dirt and misery to light the fire of poesy endlinehere  he sees the glory yet he knows that others cannot see his shows endlinehere  to them his smoke is sightless black his votive vessels but a pack of old discarded shards his fire a peddlers still to him the pyre is incensed an enduring goal endlinehere  he sighs and grubs another coal endlinehere  how should i sing when buffeting salt waves and stung with bitter surges in whose might i toss a cockleshell endlinehere  no parting cloud reveals a watery star my cries are washed away upon the wind my cramped and blistering hands can find no spar my eyes with hope oerstrained are growing blind endlinehere  but painted on the sky great visions burn my voice oblation from a shattered urn endlinehere  so up and down and forward inch by inch he gains upon the shore where poppies glow and sandflies dance their little lives away endlinehere  when the stooping sky leans down upon the hills and tenderly as one who soothing stills an anguish gathers earth to lie embraced and girdled endlinehere  do the sun filled men feel patience then endlinehere  be patient with you endlinehere  when pains iron bars their rivets tighten stern to bend and break their victims as they turn hopeless there stand the purple jars of night to spill oblivion endlinehere  do these men feel patience then endlinehere  my sun and moon endlinehere  my basketful of flowers endlinehere  my money bag of shining dreams endlinehere  my hours windless and still of afternoon endlinehere  you are my world and i your citizen endlinehere  what meaning can have patience then endlinehere  be not angry with me that i bear your colours everywhere all through each crowded street and meet the wonder light in every eye as i go by endlinehere  each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze blinded by rainbow haze the stuff of happiness no less which wraps me in its glad hued folds of peacock golds endlinehere  before my feet the dusty rough paved way flushes beneath its gray endlinehere  my steps fall ringed with light so bright it seems a myriad suns are strown about the town endlinehere  around me is the sound of steepled bells and rich perfumed smells hang like a wind forgotten cloud and shroud me from close contact with the world endlinehere  you blazon me with jewelled insignia endlinehere  a flaming nebula rims in my life endlinehere  and yet you set the word upon me unconfessed to go unguessed endlinehere  i pray to be the tool which to your hand long use has shaped and moulded till it be apt for your need and unconsideringly you take it for its service endlinehere  i demand to be forgotten in the woven strand which grows the multi coloured tapestry of your bright life and through its tissues lie a hidden strong sustaining grey toned band endlinehere  i wish to dwell around your daylight dreams the railing to the stairway of the clouds to guard your steps securely up where streams a faery moonshine washing pale the crowds of pointed stars endlinehere  remember not whereby you mount protected to the far flung sky endlinehere  before me lies a mass of shapeless days unseparated atoms and i must sort them apart and live them endlinehere  sifted dust covers the formless heap endlinehere  reprieves delays there are none ever endlinehere  as a monk who prays the sliding beads asunder so i thrust each tasteless particle aside and just begin again the task which never stays endlinehere  and i have known a glory of great suns when days flashed by pulsing with joy and fire endlinehere  drunk bubbled wine in goblets of desire and felt the whipped blood laughing as it runs endlinehere  spilt is that liquor my too hasty hand threw down the cup and did not understand endlinehere  dearest forgive that with my clumsy touch i broke and bruised your rose endlinehere  i hardly could suppose it were a thing so fragile that my clutch could kill it thus endlinehere  it stood so proudly up upon its stem i knew no thought of fear and coming very near fell overbalanced to your garments hem tearing it down endlinehere  now stooping i upgather one by one the crimson petals all outspread about my fall endlinehere  they hold their fragrance still a blood red cone of memory endlinehere  and with my words i carve a little jar to keep their scented dust which opening you must breathe to your soul and breathing know me far more grieved than you endlinehere  an arid daylight shines along the beach dried to a grey monotony of tone and stranded jelly fish melt soft upon the sun baked pebbles far beyond their reach sparkles a wet reviving sea endlinehere  here bleach the skeletons of fishes every bone polished and stark like traceries of stone the joints and knuckles hardened each to each endlinehere  and they are dead while waiting for the sea the moon pursuing sea to come again endlinehere  their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze endlinehere  only the shells and stones can wait to be washed bright endlinehere  for living things who suffer pain may not endure till time can bring them ease endlinehere  happiness to some elation is to others mere stagnation endlinehere  days of passive somnolence at its wildest indolence endlinehere  hours of empty quietness no delight and no distress endlinehere  happiness to me is wine effervescent superfine endlinehere  full of tang and fiery pleasure far too hot to leave me leisure for a single thought beyond it endlinehere  this the bond it means to give ones soul to gain lifes quintessence endlinehere  even pain pricks to livelier living then wakes the nerves to laugh again raptures self is three parts sorrow endlinehere  although we must die to morrow losing every thought but this torn triumphant drowned in bliss endlinehere  happiness we rarely feel it endlinehere  how long shall i tarnish the mirror of life a spatter of rust on its polished steel endlinehere  the seasons reel like a goaded wheel endlinehere  half numb half maddened my days are strife endlinehere  the night is sliding towards the dawn and upturned hills crouch at autumns knees endlinehere  a torn moon flees through the hemlock trees the hours have gnawed it to feed their spawn endlinehere  pursuing and jeering the misshapen thing a rabble of clouds flares out of the east endlinehere  like dogs unleashed after a beast they stream on the sky an outflung string endlinehere  a desolate wind through the unpeopled dark shakes the bushes and whistles through empty nests and the fierce unrests i keep as guests crowd my brain with corpses pallid and stark endlinehere  leave me in peace o spectres who haunt my labouring mind i have fought and failed endlinehere  i have not quailed i was all unmailed and naked i strove tis my only vaunt endlinehere  the moon drops into the silver day as waking out of her swoon she comes endlinehere  i hear the drums of millenniums beating the mornings i still must stay endlinehere  the years i must watch go in and out while i build with water and dig in air and the trumpets blare hollow despair the shuddering trumpets of utter rout endlinehere  an atom tossed in a chaos made of yeasting worlds which bubble and foam endlinehere  whence have i come endlinehere  what would be home endlinehere  i hear no answer endlinehere  i crave to be lost like a wind blown flame endlinehere  pushed into nothingness by a breath and quench in a wreath of engulfing death this fight for a god or this devils game endlinehere  there once was a man whom the gods didnt love and a disagreeable man was he endlinehere  he loathed his neighbours and his neighbours hated him and he cursed eternally endlinehere  he damned the sun and he damned the stars and he blasted the winds in the sky endlinehere  he sent to hell every green growing thing and he raved at the birds as they fly endlinehere  his oaths were many and his range was wide he swore in fancy ways but his meaning was plain that no created thing was other than a hurt to his gaze endlinehere  he dwelt all alone underneath a leaning hill and windows toward the hill there were none and on the other side they were white washed thick to keep out every spark of the sun endlinehere  when he went to market he walked all the way blaspheming at the path he trod endlinehere  he cursed at those he bought of and swore at those he sold to by all the names he knew of god endlinehere  for his heart was soured in his weary old hide and his hopes had curdled in his breast endlinehere  his friend had been untrue and his love had thrown him over for the chinking money bags she liked best endlinehere  the rats had devoured the contents of his grain bin the deer had trampled on his corn his brook had shrivelled in a summer drought and his sheep had died unshorn endlinehere  his hens wouldnt lay and his cow broke loose and his old horse perished of a colic endlinehere  in the loft his wheat bags were nibbled into holes by little glutton mice on a frolic endlinehere  so he slowly lost all he ever had and the blood in his body dried endlinehere  shrunken and mean he still lived on and cursed that future which had lied endlinehere  so he dug and he delved with care and pain and the veins in his forehead stood taut endlinehere  at the end of an hour when every bone cracked he gathered up what he had sought endlinehere  a dim old vase of crusted glass prismed while it lay buried deep endlinehere  shifting reds and greens like a pigeons neck at the touch of the sun began to leap endlinehere  it was dull in the tree shade but glowing in the light flashing like an opal stone carved into a flagon and the colours glanced and ran where at first there had seemed to be none endlinehere  it had handles on each side to bear it up and a belly for the gurgling wine endlinehere  its neck was slender and its mouth was wide and its lip was curled and fine endlinehere  then he carried it home and put it on a shelf but it was only grey in the gloom endlinehere  so he fetched a pail and a bit of cloth and he went outside with a broom endlinehere  the old man forgot to swear watching its shadow grown a mammoth size dancing in the kitchen there endlinehere  he forgot to revile the sun next morning when he found his vase afire in its light endlinehere  and he carried it out of the house that day and kept it close beside him until night endlinehere  and so it happened from day to day endlinehere  the old man fed his life on the beauty of his vase on its perfect shape endlinehere  and his soul forgot its former strife endlinehere  and the village folk came and begged to see the flagon which was dug from the ground endlinehere  and the old man never thought of an oath in his joy at showing what he had found endlinehere  one day the master of the village school passed him as he stooped at toil hoeing for a bean row and at his side was the vase on the turned up soil endlinehere  my friend said the schoolmaster pompous and kind thats a valuable thing you have there but it might get broken out of doors it should meet with the utmost care endlinehere  what are you doing with it out here endlinehere  why sir said the poor old man i like to have it about do you see endlinehere  to be with it all i can endlinehere  you will smash it said the schoolmaster sternly right mark my words and see endlinehere  and he walked away while the old man looked at his treasure despondingly endlinehere  then he smiled to himself for it was his endlinehere  he had toiled for it and now he cared endlinehere  loved its shape and its subtle swift hues which his own hard work had bared endlinehere  he would carry it round with him everywhere as it gave him joy to do endlinehere  a fragile vase should not stand in a bean row endlinehere  who would dare to say so endlinehere  then his heart was rested and his fears gave way and he bent to his hoe again endlinehere  a clod rolled down and his foot slipped back and he lurched with a cry of pain endlinehere  for the blade of the hoe crashed into glass and the vase fell to iridescent sherds endlinehere  the old mans body heaved with slow dry sobs endlinehere  he did not curse he had no words endlinehere  he gathered the fragments one by one and his fingers were cut and torn endlinehere  then he made a hole in the very place whence the beautiful vase had been borne endlinehere  he covered the hole and he patted it down then he hobbled to his house and shut the door endlinehere  he tore up his coat and nailed it at the windows that no beam of light should cross the floor endlinehere  he sat down in front of the empty hearth and he neither ate nor drank endlinehere  in three days they found him dead and cold and they said what a queer old crank endlinehere  have at you you devils endlinehere  my backs to this tree for youre nothing so nice that the hind side of me would escape your assault endlinehere  come on now all three endlinehere  heres a dandified gentleman rapier at point and a wrist which whirls round like a circular joint endlinehere  thats just to anoint and make supple your limbs endlinehere  tis a pity the silk of your waistcoat is stained endlinehere  your hearts full of milk and so full it spills over endlinehere  im not of your ilk endlinehere  you said so and laughed at my old fashioned hose at the cut of my hair at the length of my nose endlinehere  to carve it to pattern i think you propose endlinehere  your pardon young sir but my nose and my sword are proving themselves in quite perfect accord endlinehere  i grieve to have spotted your shirt endlinehere  that blades not a stick to slash right and left and my skull is too thick to be cleft with such cuffs of a sword endlinehere  now a lick down the side of your face endlinehere  what a pretty red line endlinehere  tell the taverns that scar was an honour endlinehere  dont whine that a stranger has marked you endlinehere  the trees there you swine endlinehere  did you think to get in at the back while your friends made a little diversion in front endlinehere  so it ends with your sword clattering down on the ground endlinehere  tis amends i make for your courteous reception of me a foreigner landed from over the sea endlinehere  your welcome was fervent i think youll agree endlinehere  my shoes are not buckled with gold nor my hair oiled and scented my jackets not satin i wear corded breeches wide hats and i make people stare endlinehere  so i do but my heart is the heart of a man and my thoughts cannot twirl in the limited span twixt my head and my heels as some other mens can endlinehere  i have business more strange than the shape of my boots and my interests range from the sky to the roots of this dung hill you live in you half rotted shoots of a mouldering tree endlinehere  heres at you once more endlinehere  you can show me the door and jeer at my ways but youre pinked to the core endlinehere  and before i have done i will prick my name in with the front of my steel and your lily white skin shall be printed with me endlinehere  for ive come here to win endlinehere  my cup is empty to night cold and dry are its sides chilled by the wind from the open window endlinehere  empty and void it sparkles white in the moonlight endlinehere  the room is filled with the strange scent of wistaria blossoms endlinehere  they sway in the moons radiance and tap against the wall endlinehere  but the cup of my heart is still and cold and empty endlinehere  when you come it brims red and trembling with blood hearts blood for your drinking to fill your mouth with love and the bitter sweet taste of a soul endlinehere  my words are little jars for you to take and put upon a shelf endlinehere  their shapes are quaint and beautiful and they have many pleasant colours and lustres to recommend them endlinehere  also the scent from them fills the room with sweetness of flowers and crushed grasses endlinehere  you glow in my heart like the flames of uncounted candles endlinehere  but when i go to warm my hands my clumsiness overturns the light and then i stumble against the tables and chairs endlinehere  outside the long window with his head on the stone sill the dog is lying gazing at his beloved endlinehere  his eyes are wet and urgent and his body is taut and shaking endlinehere  it is cold on the terrace a pale wind licks along the stone slabs but the dog gazes through the glass and is content endlinehere  the beloved is writing a letter endlinehere  occasionally she speaks to the dog but she is thinking of her writing endlinehere  does she too give her devotion to one not worthy endlinehere  licking passions have bitten their arabesques into it and the mark of them lies in and out worm like with the beauty of corroded copper patterning white steel endlinehere  my brain is curved like a scimitar and sighs at its cutting like a sickle mowing grass endlinehere  but of what use is all this to me endlinehere  i who am set to crack stones in a country lane endlinehere  my heart is like a cleft pomegranate bleeding crimson seeds and dripping them on the ground endlinehere  my heart gapes because it is ripe and over full and its seeds are bursting from it endlinehere  but how is this other than a torment to me endlinehere  i who am shut up with broken crockery in a dark closet endlinehere  i have been temperate always but i am like to be very drunk with your coming endlinehere  there have been times i feared to walk down the street lest i should reel with the wine of you and jerk against my neighbours as they go by endlinehere  i will mix me a drink of stars large stars with polychrome needles small stars jetting maroon and crimson cool quiet green stars endlinehere  it will lap and scratch as i swallow it down and i shall feel it as a serpent of fire coiling and twisting in my belly endlinehere  the rain gullies the garden paths and tinkles on the broad sides of grass blades endlinehere  a tree at the end of my arm is hazy with mist endlinehere  even so i can see that it has red berries a scarlet fruit filmed over with moisture endlinehere  it seems as though the rain dripping from it should be tinged with colour endlinehere  i desire the berries but in the mist i only scratch my hand on the thorns endlinehere  probably too they are bitter endlinehere  hold your apron wide that i may pour my gifts into it so that scarcely shall your two arms hinder them from falling to the ground endlinehere  i would pour them upon you and cover you for greatly do i feel this need of giving you something even these poor things endlinehere  dearest of my heart endlinehere  when i go away from you the world beats dead like a slackened drum endlinehere  i call out for you against the jutted stars and shout into the ridges of the wind endlinehere  streets coming fast one after the other wedge you away from me and the lamps of the city prick my eyes so that i can no longer see your face endlinehere  why should i leave you to wound myself upon the sharp edges of the night endlinehere  hold your soul open for my welcoming endlinehere  let the quiet of your spirit bathe me with its clear and rippled coolness that loose limbed and weary i find rest outstretched upon your peace as on a bed of ivory endlinehere  between us leapt a gold and scarlet flame endlinehere  into the hollow of the cupped arched blue of heaven it rose endlinehere  its flickering tongues up drew and vanished in the sunshine endlinehere  how it came we guessed not nor what thing could be its name endlinehere  from each to each had sprung those sparks which flew together into fire endlinehere  but we knew the winds would slap and quench it in their game endlinehere  and so we graved and fashioned marble blocks to treasure it and placed them round about endlinehere  with pillared porticos we wreathed the whole and roofed it with bright bronze endlinehere  behind carved locks flowered the tall and sheltered flame endlinehere  without the baffled winds thrust at a columns bole endlinehere  beneath this sod lie the remains of one who died of growing pains endlinehere  you ask me for a sonnet endlinehere  ah my dear can clocks tick back to yesterday at noon endlinehere  can cracked and fallen leaves recall last june and leap up on the boughs now stiff and sere endlinehere  yes tis that endlinehere  my shadow stretches forward and the ground is dark in front because the lights behind endlinehere  it is grotesque with such a funny hat in watching it and walking i have found more than enough to occupy my mind endlinehere  i cannot turn the light would make me blind endlinehere  a yellow band of light upon the street pours from an open door and makes a wide pathway of bright gold across a sheet of calm and liquid moonshine endlinehere  from inside come shouts and streams of laughter and a snatch of song soon drowned and lost again in mirth the clip of tankards on a table top and stir of booted heels endlinehere  against the patch of candle light a shadow falls its girth proclaims the host himself and master of his shop endlinehere  this is the tavern of one hilverdink jan hilverdink whose wines are much esteemed endlinehere  within his cellar men can have to drink the rarest cordials old monks ever schemed to coax from pulpy grapes and with nice art improve and spice their virgin juiciness endlinehere  here froths the amber beer of many a brew crowning each pewter tankard with as smart a cap as ever in his wantonness winter set glittering on top of an old yew endlinehere  tall candles stand upon the table where are twisted glasses ruby sparked with wine clarets and ports endlinehere  those topaz bumpers were drained from slim long necked bottles of the rhine endlinehere  the centre of the board is piled with pipes slender and clean the still unbaptized clay awaits its burning fate endlinehere  behind the vault stretches from dim to dark a groping way bordered by casks and puncheons whose brass stripes and bands gleam dully still beyond the gay tumult endlinehere  for good old master hilverdink a toast endlinehere  clamoured a youth with tassels on his boots endlinehere  bring out your oldest brandy for a boast from that small barrel in the very roots of your deep cellar man endlinehere  why here is max endlinehere  welcome max youre scarcely here in time endlinehere  we want to drink to old jans luck and smoke his best tobacco for a grand climax endlinehere  here jan a paper fragrant as crushed thyme well have the best to wish you luck or may we choke endlinehere  max breuck unclasped his broadcloth cloak and sat endlinehere  well thought of franz heres luck to mynheer jan endlinehere  the host set down a jar then to a vat lost in the distance of his cellar ran endlinehere  max took a pipe as graceful as the stem of some long tulip crammed it full and drew the pungent smoke deep to his grateful lung endlinehere  it curled all blue throughout the cave and flew into the silver night endlinehere  at once there flung into the crowded shop a boy who cried to them oh sirs is there some learned lawyer here some advocate or all wise counsellor endlinehere  my master sent me to inquire where such men do mostly be but every door was shut and barred for late has grown the hour endlinehere  i pray you tell me where i may now find one versed in law the matter will not wait endlinehere  i am a lawyer boy said max my mind is not locked to my business though tis late endlinehere  i shall be glad to serve what way is in my power endlinehere  then once more cloaked and ready he set out tripping the footsteps of the eager boy along the dappled cobbles while the rout within the tavern jeered at his employ endlinehere  through new burst elm leaves filtered the white moon who peered and splashed between the twinkling boughs flooded the open spaces and took flight before tall serried houses in platoon guarded by shadows endlinehere  past the custom house they took their hurried way in the spring scented night endlinehere  before a door which fronted a canal the boy halted endlinehere  a dim tree shaded spot endlinehere  the water lapped the stones in musical and rhythmic tappings and a galliot slumbered at anchor with no light aboard endlinehere  the boy knocked twice and steps approached endlinehere  a flame winked through the keyhole then a key was turned and through the open door max went toward another door whence sound of voices came endlinehere  he entered a large room where candelabra burned endlinehere  an aged man in quilted dressing gown rose up to greet him endlinehere  sir said max you sent your messenger to seek throughout the town a lawyer endlinehere  i have small accomplishment but i am at your service and my name is max breuck counsellor at your command endlinehere  mynheer replied the aged man obliged am i and count myself much privileged endlinehere  i am cornelius kurler and my fame is better known on distant oceans than on land endlinehere  my ship has tasted water in strange seas and bartered goods at still uncharted isles endlinehere  shes oft coquetted with a tropic breeze and sheered off hurricanes with jaunty smiles endlinehere  tush kurler here broke in the other man enough of poetry draw the deed and sign endlinehere  the old man seemed to wizen at the voice my good friend grootver he at once began endlinehere  no introductions let us have some wine and business now that you at last have made your choice endlinehere  a harsh and disagreeable man he proved to be this grootver with no single kindly thought endlinehere  kurler explained his old hands nervously twisting his beard endlinehere  his vessel he had bought from grootver endlinehere  little by little max made out the way that grootver pressed that poor harassed old man endlinehere  his money he must have too long delay had turned the usurer to a ruffian endlinehere  such light and foamy silks like crinkled cream and indigo more blue than sun whipped seas spices and fragrant trees a massive beam of sandalwood and pungent china teas tobacco coffee endlinehere  grootver only laughed endlinehere  max heard it all and worse than all he heard the deed to which the sailor gave his word endlinehere  he shivered twas as if the villain gaffed the old man with a boat hook bleeding spent he begged for life nor knew at all the road he went endlinehere  for kurler had a daughter young and gay carefully reared and shielded rarely seen endlinehere  but on one black and most unfriendly day grootver had caught her as she passed between the kitchen and the garden endlinehere  she had run in fear of him his evil leering eye and when he came she bolted in her room refused to show though gave no reason why endlinehere  the spinning of her future had begun on quiet nights she heard the whirring of her doom endlinehere  max mended an old goosequill by the fire loathing his work but seeing no thing to do endlinehere  he felt his hands were building up the pyre to burn two souls and seized with vertigo he staggered to his chair endlinehere  before him lay white paper still unspotted by a crime endlinehere  now young man write said grootver in his ear endlinehere  if in two years my vessel should yet stay from amsterdam i give grootver sometime a friend my daughter for his lawful wife endlinehere  and kurler swore a palsied tottering sound and traced his name a shaking wandering line endlinehere  then dazed he sat there speechless from his wound endlinehere  grootver got up fair voyage the brigantine endlinehere  he shuffled from the room and left the house endlinehere  his footsteps wore to silence down the street endlinehere  at last the aged man began to rouse endlinehere  with help he once more gained his trembling feet endlinehere  my daughter mynheer breuck is friendless now endlinehere  will you watch over her endlinehere  i ask a solemn vow endlinehere  max laid his hand upon the old mans arm before god sir i vow when you are gone so to protect your daughter from all harm as one man may endlinehere  thus sorrowful forlorn the situation to max breuck appeared he gave his promise almost without thought nor looked to see a difficulty endlinehere  bred gently to watch a mother left alone bound by a dying fathers wish who feared the worlds accustomed harshness when he should be dead such was my case from youth mynheer kurler endlinehere  last winter she died also and my days are passed in work lest i should grieve for her and undo habits used to earn her praise endlinehere  my leisure i will gladly give to see your household and your daughter prosperous endlinehere  the sailor said his thanks but turned away endlinehere  he could not brook that his humility so little wonted and so tremulous should first before a stranger make such great display endlinehere  come here to morrow as the bells ring noon i sail at the full sea my daughter then i will make known to you endlinehere  twill be a boon if after i have bid good by and when her eyeballs scorch with watching me depart you bring her home again endlinehere  she lives with one old serving woman who has brought her up endlinehere  but that is no friend for so free a heart endlinehere  no head to match her questions endlinehere  it is done endlinehere  and i must sail away to come and brim her cup endlinehere  my ships the fastest that owns amsterdam as home so not a letter can you send endlinehere  i shall be back before to where i am another ship could reach endlinehere  now your stipend quickly breuck interposed endlinehere  when you once more tread on the stones which pave our streets endlinehere  to morrow i will be at stroke of noon at the great wharf endlinehere  then hurrying in spite of cake and wine the old man pressed upon him ere he went he took his leave and shut the door endlinehere  twas noon in amsterdam the day was clear and sunshine tipped the pointed roofs with gold endlinehere  the brown canals ran liquid bronze for here the sun sank deep into the waters cold endlinehere  and every clock and belfry in the town hammered and struck and rang endlinehere  such peals of bells to shake the sunny morning into life and to proclaim the middle and the crown of this most sparkling daytime endlinehere  the crowd swells laughing and pushing toward the quays in friendly strife endlinehere  the horn of fortune sails away to day endlinehere  at highest tide she lets her anchor go and starts for china endlinehere  giddy in freshest paint she curtseys low and beckons to her boats to let her start endlinehere  blue is the ocean with a flashing breeze endlinehere  the shining waves are quick to take her part endlinehere  they push and spatter her endlinehere  her sails are loose her tackles hanging waiting men to seize and haul them taut with chanty singing as they choose endlinehere  at the great wharfs edge mynheer kurler stands and by his side his daughter young christine endlinehere  max breuck is there his hat held in his hands bowing before them both endlinehere  the brigantine bounces impatient at the long delay curvets and jumps a cables length from shore endlinehere  a heavy galliot unloads on the walls round yellow cheeses like gold cannon balls stacked on the stones in pyramids endlinehere  once more kurler has kissed christine and now he is away endlinehere  christine stood rigid like a frozen stone her hands wrung pale in effort at control endlinehere  max moved aside and let her be alone for grief exacts each penny of its toll endlinehere  the dancing boat tossed on the glinting sea endlinehere  a sun path swallowed it in flaming light then shrunk a cockleshell it came again upon the other side endlinehere  now on the lee it took the horn of fortune endlinehere  straining sight could see it hauled aboard men pulling on the crane endlinehere  then up above the eager brigantine along her slender masts the sails took flight were sheeted home and ropes were coiled endlinehere  the shine of the wet anchor when its heavy weight rose splashing to the deck endlinehere  these things they saw christine and max upon the crowded quay endlinehere  they saw the sails grow white then blue in shade the ship had turned caught in a windy flaw she glided imperceptibly away drew farther off and in the bright sky seemed to fade endlinehere  home through the emptying streets max took christine who would have hid her sorrow from his gaze endlinehere  before the iron gateway clasped between each garden wall he stopped endlinehere  she in amaze asked do you enter not then mynheer breuck endlinehere  my father told me of your courtesy endlinehere  since i am now your charge tis meet for me to show such hospitality as maiden may without disdaining rules must not be broke endlinehere  katrina will have coffee and she bakes today endlinehere  she straight unhasped the tall beflowered gate endlinehere  max started at the beauty at the glare of tints endlinehere  at either end was set a wide path strewn with fine red gravel and such shows of tulips in their splendour flaunted everywhere endlinehere  from side to side midway each path there ran a longer one which cut the space in two endlinehere  then the dame katrina shook them down in pelting showers they plunged to earth and died transformed to sugared food endlinehere  against the high encircling walls were grapes nailed close to feel the baking of the sun from glowing bricks endlinehere  their microscopic shapes half hidden by serrated leaves endlinehere  and one old cherry tossed its branches near the door endlinehere  bordered along the wall in beds between flickering streaming nodding in the air the pride of all the garden there were more tulips than max had ever dreamed or seen endlinehere  they jostled mobbed and danced endlinehere  max stood at helpless stare endlinehere  within the arbour mynheer breuck ill bring coffee and cakes a pipe and fathers best tobacco brought from countries harbouring dawns earliest footstep endlinehere  with girlish zest to please her guest she flew endlinehere  a moment more she came again with her old nurse behind endlinehere  then sitting on the bench and knitting fast she talked as someone with a noble store of hidden fancies blown upon the wind eager to flutter forth and leave their silent past endlinehere  the little apple leaves above their heads let fall a quivering sunshine endlinehere  quiet cool in blossomed boughs they sat endlinehere  beyond the beds of tulips blazed a proper vestibule and antechamber to the rainbow endlinehere  dyes of prismed richness carmine endlinehere  blues tinging dark browns to purple endlinehere  silvers flushed to amethyst and tinct with gold endlinehere  round eyes of scarlet spotting tender saffron hues endlinehere  violets sunk to blacks and reds in orange crushed endlinehere  of every pattern and in every shade endlinehere  nacreous iridescent mottled checked endlinehere  some purest sulphur yellow others made an ivory white with disks of copper flecked endlinehere  sprinkled and striped tasselled or keenest edged endlinehere  striated powdered freckled long or short endlinehere  they bloomed and seemed strange wonder moths new fledged born of the spectrum wedded to a flame endlinehere  the shade within the arbour made a port to oertaxed eyes its still green twilight rest became endlinehere  her knitting needles clicked and christine talked this child matured to woman unaware the first time left alone endlinehere  now dreams once balked found utterance endlinehere  max thought her very fair endlinehere  beneath her cap her ornaments shone gold and purest gold they were endlinehere  kurler was rich and heedful endlinehere  her old maiden aunt had died whose darling care she was endlinehere  now growing bold she asked had max a sister endlinehere  dropped a stitch at her own candour endlinehere  then she paused and softly sighed endlinehere  two years was long endlinehere  she loved her father well but fears she had not endlinehere  he had always been just sailed or sailing endlinehere  and she must not dwell on sad thoughts he had told her so and seen her smile at parting endlinehere  but she sighed once more endlinehere  two years was long twas not one hour yet endlinehere  mynheer grootver she would not see at all endlinehere  yes yes she knew but ere the date so set the horn of fortune would be at the wall endlinehere  when max had bid farewell she watched him from the door endlinehere  such things were christines world and his was she winter drew near his sun was in her smiles endlinehere  another spring and at his law he toiled unspoken hope counselled a wise efficiency endlinehere  max breuck was honours soul he knew himself the guardian of this girl no more no less endlinehere  as one in charge of guineas on a shelf loose in a china teapot may confess his need but may not borrow till his friend comes back to give endlinehere  so max in honour said no word of love or marriage but the days he clipped off on his almanac endlinehere  the end must come endlinehere  the second year with feet of lead lagged slowly by till spring had plumped the willow sprays endlinehere  two years had made christine a woman grown with dignity and gently certain pride endlinehere  but all her childhood fancies had not flown her thoughts in lovely dreamings seemed to glide endlinehere  max was her trusted friend did she confess a closer happiness endlinehere  max could not tell endlinehere  two years were over and his life he found sphered and complete endlinehere  in restless eagerness he waited for the horn of fortune endlinehere  well had he his promise kept abating not one pound endlinehere  spring slipped away to summer endlinehere  still no glass sighted the brigantine endlinehere  then grootver came demanding jufvrouw kurler endlinehere  his trespass was justified for he had won the game endlinehere  christine begged time more time endlinehere  midsummer went and grootver waxed impatient endlinehere  still the ship tarried endlinehere  christine betrayed and weary sank to dreadful terrors endlinehere  one day crazed she sent for max endlinehere  come quickly said her note i skip the worst distress until we meet endlinehere  the world is blank endlinehere  through the long sunshine of late afternoon max went to her endlinehere  in the pleached alley lost in bitter reverie he found her soon endlinehere  and sitting down beside her at the cost of all his secret dear said he what thing so suddenly has happened endlinehere  then in tears she told that grootver on the following morn would come to marry her and shuddering i will die rather death has lesser fears endlinehere  max felt the shackles drop from the oath which he had sworn endlinehere  my dearest one the hid joy of my heart endlinehere  i love you oh endlinehere  you must indeed have known endlinehere  in strictest honour i have played my part but all this misery has overthrown my scruples endlinehere  if you love me marry me before the sun has dipped behind those trees endlinehere  you cannot be wed twice and grootver foiled can eat his anger endlinehere  my care it shall be to pay your fathers debt by such degrees as i can compass and for years ive greatly toiled endlinehere  this is not haste christine for long ive known my love and silence forced upon my lips endlinehere  i worship you with all the strength ive shown in keeping faith endlinehere  with pleading finger tips he touched her arm endlinehere  dearest speak i love you endlinehere  do my words fall too swift now endlinehere  theyve been in leash so long upon the brink endlinehere  she sat quite still her body loose and weak endlinehere  then into him she melted all her soul at flow endlinehere  and they were married ere the westering sun had disappeared behind the garden trees endlinehere  the evening poured on them its benison and flower scents that only night time frees rose up around them from the beamy ground silvered and shadowed by a tranquil moon endlinehere  within the arbour long they lay embraced in such enraptured sweetness as they found close partnered each to each and thinking soon to be enwoven long ere night to morning faced endlinehere  then far spent our eyes will close to undisturbed rest endlinehere  for that desired thing i leave you now endlinehere  to pinnacle this days accomplishment by telling grootver that a bootless quest is his and that his schemes have met a knock down blow endlinehere  but christine clung to him with sobbing cries pleading for loves sake that he leave her not endlinehere  and wound her arms about his knees and thighs as he stood over her endlinehere  with dread begot of grootvers name and silence and the night she shook and trembled endlinehere  words in moaning plaint wooed him to stay endlinehere  she feared she knew not why yet greatly feared endlinehere  she seemed some anguished saint martyred by visions endlinehere  max breuck soothed her fright with wisdom then stepped out under the cooling sky endlinehere  but at the gate once more she held him close and quenched her heart again upon his lips endlinehere  my sweetheart why this terror endlinehere  i propose but to be gone one hour endlinehere  evening slips away this errand must be done endlinehere  first goes my father if i lose you now endlinehere  she grasped him as in panic lest she drown endlinehere  softly he laughed one hour through the town by moonlight endlinehere  thats no place for foul attacks endlinehere  dearest be comforted and clear that troubled brow endlinehere  one hour dear and then no more alone endlinehere  we front another day as man and wife endlinehere  i shall be back almost before im gone and midnight shall anoint and crown our life endlinehere  then through the gate he passed endlinehere  along the street she watched his buttons gleaming in the moon endlinehere  he stopped to wave and turned the garden wall endlinehere  straight she sank down upon a mossy seat endlinehere  her senses mist encircled by a swoon swayed to unconsciousness beneath its wreathing pall endlinehere  briskly max walked beside the still canal endlinehere  his step was firm with purpose endlinehere  not a jot he feared this meeting nor the rancorous gall grootver would spit on him who marred his plot endlinehere  he dreaded no man since he could protect christine endlinehere  he stopped and laughed aloud endlinehere  his starved life had not fitted him for joy endlinehere  it strained him to the utmost to reject even this hour with her endlinehere  his heart beat loud endlinehere  damn grootver who can force my time to this employ endlinehere  what boyish uncontrol to be so racked endlinehere  then felt his ticking watch endlinehere  in half an hour grootver would know the whole endlinehere  and he would be returned lifting the latch of his own gate eager to take christine and crush her to his lips endlinehere  how bear delay endlinehere  he broke into a run endlinehere  in front a line of candle light banded the cobbled street endlinehere  not for many a day had he been there to take his old accustomed seat endlinehere  and out they came pell mell his old companions endlinehere  max where have you been endlinehere  not drink with us endlinehere  indeed you serve us well endlinehere  how many months is it since we have seen you here endlinehere  jan jan you slow old doddering goat endlinehere  heres mynheer breuck come back again at last stir your old bones to welcome him endlinehere  fill your throat heres beer or brandy endlinehere  now boys hold him fast endlinehere  put down your cane dear man endlinehere  what really vicious whacks endlinehere  they forced him to a seat and held him there despite his anger while the hideous joke was tossed from hand to hand endlinehere  franz poured with care a brimming glass of whiskey endlinehere  here weve broke into a virgin barrel for you drink endlinehere  married and out on business endlinehere  which lies the likeliest endlinehere  come max do think endlinehere  swollen with fury struggling with these men max cursed hilarity which must needs have a mark endlinehere  forcing himself to steadiness he tried to quell the uproar told them what he dared of his own life and circumstance endlinehere  implied most urgent matters time could ill be spared endlinehere  in jesting mood his comrades heard his tale and scoffed at it endlinehere  he felt his anger more goaded and bursting cowards endlinehere  is no one loth to mock at duty here they called for ale and forced a pipe upon him endlinehere  with an oath he shivered it to fragments on the earthen floor endlinehere  sobered a little by his violence and by the host who begged them to be still nor injure his good name max no offence they blurted you may leave now if you will endlinehere  weve gone too far endlinehere  i ask your pardon for our foolish joke endlinehere  it started in a wager ere you came endlinehere  the talk somehow had falln on drugs a jar i brought from china herbs the natives smoke was with me and i thought merely to play a game endlinehere  its properties are to induce a sleep fraught with adventure and the flight of time is inconceivable in swiftness endlinehere  deep sunken in slumber imageries sublime flatter the senses or some fearful dream holds them enmeshed endlinehere  years pass which on the clock are but so many seconds endlinehere  we agreed that the next man who came should prove the scheme and you were he endlinehere  and then the pipe was broke and you were freed endlinehere  max breuck was maddened now endlinehere  another jest of your befuddled wits endlinehere  i know not why i am to be your butt endlinehere  at my request youll choose among you one wholl answer for your most unseasonable mirth endlinehere  youll hear from me endlinehere  but franz had caught him at the very door it is no lie max breuck and for your plight i am to blame endlinehere  come back and well talk quietly endlinehere  you have no business that is why we laughed since you had none a few minutes ago endlinehere  as to your wedding naturally we chaffed knowing the length of time it takes to do a simple thing like that in this slow world endlinehere  indeed max twas a dream endlinehere  forgive me then endlinehere  ill burn the drug if you prefer endlinehere  but breuck muttered and stared a lie endlinehere  and then he hurled distraught this word at franz prove it endlinehere  and when its proven ill believe endlinehere  that thing shall be your work endlinehere  ill give you just one week to make your case endlinehere  on august thirty first eighteen fourteen i shall require your proof endlinehere  with wondering face franz cried a week to august and fourteen the year endlinehere  youre mad tis april now endlinehere  april and eighteen twelve endlinehere  max staggered caught a chair april two years ago endlinehere  indeed or you or i are mad endlinehere  i know not how either could blunder so endlinehere  hilverdink brought the amsterdam gazette and max was forced to read endlinehere  eighteen hundred and twelve in largest print and next to it april the twenty first endlinehere  the letters smeared and jumbled but by dint of straining every nerve to meet the worst he read it and into his pounding brain tumbled a horror endlinehere  like a roaring sea foreboding shipwreck came the message plain this is two years ago endlinehere  what of christine endlinehere  he fled the cellar in his agony running to outstrip fate and save his holy shrine endlinehere  the darkened buildings echoed to his feet clap clapping on the pavement as he ran endlinehere  across moon misted squares clamoured his fleet and terror winged steps endlinehere  his heart began to labour at the speed endlinehere  and still no sign no flutter of a leaf against the sky endlinehere  and this should be the garden wall and round the corner the old gate endlinehere  no even line was this endlinehere  and then a fearful cry shattered the stillness endlinehere  two stiff houses filled the ground endlinehere  shoulder to shoulder like dragoons in line they stood and max knew them to be the ones to right and left of kurlers garden endlinehere  spine rigid next frozen spine endlinehere  no mellow tones of ancient gilded iron undulate expanding in wide circles and broad curves the twisted iron of the garden gate was there endlinehere  the houses touched and left no space between endlinehere  with glassy eyes and shaking nerves max gazed endlinehere  then mad with fear fled still and left that place endlinehere  stumbling and panting on he ran and on endlinehere  his slobbering lips could only cry christine endlinehere  where are you gone endlinehere  what future is our past endlinehere  what saturnine sardonic devils jest has bid us live two years together in a puff of smoke endlinehere  it was no dream i swear it endlinehere  in some star or still imprisoned in times egg you give me love endlinehere  dearest dear this stroke shall never part us i will reach to where you are endlinehere  his burning eyeballs stared into the dark endlinehere  the moon had long been set endlinehere  and still he cried christine endlinehere  his youth had taught their meaning now they closed upon his dream endlinehere  softly he knocked against the casement wide it flew and a cracked voice his business there demanded endlinehere  the door opened and inside max stepped endlinehere  he saw a candle held in air above the head of a gray bearded jew endlinehere  simeon isaacs mynheer can i serve you endlinehere  do you keep arms endlinehere  i want a pistol endlinehere  quick the old man grew livid endlinehere  mynheer a pistol endlinehere  let me swerve you from your purpose endlinehere  life brings often false alarms peace good old isaacs why should you suppose my purpose deadly endlinehere  in good truth ive been blest above others endlinehere  you have many rows of pistols it would seem endlinehere  here this shagreen case holds one that i fancy endlinehere  silvered mounts are to my taste endlinehere  twill serve my turn though hastily he counts the florins down upon the table endlinehere  well good night and wish me luck for your to morrows toast endlinehere  into the night again he hurried now pale and in haste and far beyond the town he set his goal endlinehere  and then he wondered how poor c endlinehere  had come to die endlinehere  its grown handy in killing maybe this ive bought and will work punctually endlinehere  his sorrow fell upon his senses shutting out all else endlinehere  again he wept and called and blindly fought the heavy miles away endlinehere  my own wife endlinehere  he lurched with failing pulse endlinehere  along the dyke the keen air blew in gusts and grasses bent and wailed before the wind endlinehere  the zuider zee which croons all night and thrusts long stealthy fingers up some way to find and crumble down the stones moaned baffled endlinehere  here the wide armed windmills looked like gallows trees endlinehere  no lights were burning in the distant thorps endlinehere  max laid aside his coat endlinehere  his mind half clear babbled christine endlinehere  a shot split through the breeze endlinehere  the cold stars winked and glittered at his chilling corpse endlinehere  dear virgin mary far away look down from heaven while i pray endlinehere  open your golden casement high and lean way out beyond the sky endlinehere  i am so little it may be a task for you to harken me endlinehere  o lady mary i have bought a candle as the good priest taught endlinehere  i only had one penny so old goody jenkins let it go endlinehere  it is a little bent you see endlinehere  but oh be merciful to me endlinehere  i have not anything to give yet i so long for him to live endlinehere  a year ago he sailed away and not a word unto today endlinehere  ive strained my eyes from the sea wall but never does he come at all endlinehere  other ships have entered port their voyages finished long or short and other sailors have received their welcomes while i sat and grieved endlinehere  my heart is bursting for his hail o virgin let me spy his sail endlinehere  _hull down on the edge of a sun soaked sea sparkle the bellying sails for me endlinehere  taut to the push of a rousing wind shaking the sea till it foams behind the tightened rigging is shrill with the song we are back again who were gone so long endlinehere  _ one afternoon i bumped my head endlinehere  i sat on a post and wished i were dead like father and mother for no one cared whither i went or how i fared endlinehere  a mans voice said my little lad heres a bit of a toy to make you glad endlinehere  he held out his hand and gave to me the most marvellous top which could ever be endlinehere  it had ivory eyes and jet black rings and a red stone carved into little wings all joined by a twisted golden line and set in the brown wood even and fine endlinehere  it couldnt mean quite the same to you endlinehere  every day i met him there where the fisher nets dry in the sunny air endlinehere  he told me stories of courts and kings of storms at sea of lots of things endlinehere  the top he said was a sort of sign that something in the big world was mine endlinehere  _blue and white on a sun shot ocean endlinehere  against the horizon a glint in motion endlinehere  full in the grasp of a shoving wind trailing her bubbles of foam behind singing and shouting to port she races a flying harp with her sheets and braces endlinehere  _ o queen of heaven give me heed i am in very utmost need endlinehere  he loved me he was all i had and when he came it made the sad thoughts disappear endlinehere  this very day send his ship home to me i pray endlinehere  ill be a priest if you want it so ill work till i have enough to go and study latin to say the prayers on the rosary our old priest wears endlinehere  i wished to be a sailor too but i will give myself to you endlinehere  ill never even spin my top but put it away in a box endlinehere  ill stop whistling the sailor songs he taught endlinehere  ill save my pennies till i have bought a silver heart in the market square ive seen some beautiful white ones there endlinehere  ill give up all i want to do and do whatever you tell me to endlinehere  heavenly lady take away all the games i like to play take my life to fill the score only bring him back once more endlinehere  _the poplars shiver and turn their leaves and the wind through the belfry moans and grieves endlinehere  the gray dust whirls in the market square and the silver hearts are covered with care by thick tarpaulins endlinehere  once again the bay is black under heavy rain endlinehere  _ the queen of heaven has shut her door endlinehere  a little boy weeps and prays no more endlinehere  but why did i kill him endlinehere  in the small gilded room near the stair endlinehere  my ears rack and throb with his cry and his eyes goggle under his hair as my fingers sink into the fair white skin of his throat endlinehere  i killed him endlinehere  i shook him until his red tongue hung flapping out through the black queer swollen lines of his lips endlinehere  and i clung with my nails drawing blood while i flung the loose heavy body in fear endlinehere  fear lest he should still not be dead endlinehere  i was drunk with the lust of his life endlinehere  the blood drops oozed slow from his head and dabbled a chair endlinehere  and our strife lasted one reeling second his knife lay and winked in the lights overhead endlinehere  and the waltz from the ballroom i heard when i called him a low sneaking cur endlinehere  and the wail of the violins stirred my brute anger with visions of her endlinehere  as i throttled his windpipe the purr of his breath with the waltz became blurred endlinehere  i have ridden ten miles through the dark with that music an infernal din pounding rhythmic inside me endlinehere  and my fingers sink in to his flesh when the violins thin and straining with passion grow stark endlinehere  oh the horror of sound endlinehere  while she danced i was crushing his throat endlinehere  he had tasted the joy of her wound round her body and i heard him gloat on the favour endlinehere  that instant i smote endlinehere  how the dancers swirl round endlinehere  he is here in the room in my arm his limp body hangs on the spin of the waltz we are dancing a swarm of blood drops is hemming us in endlinehere  and his sin is red like his tongue lolling warm endlinehere  and the drums are his knell endlinehere  he is heavy his feet beat the floor as i drag him about in the swell of the waltz endlinehere  with a menacing roar the trumpets crash in through the door endlinehere  clangs his funeral bell endlinehere  in the chaos of space rolls the earth to the hideous glee of death endlinehere  and so cramped is this place i stifle and pant endlinehere  tis he throttles me endlinehere  he has covered my mouth with his face endlinehere  and his blood has dripped into my heart endlinehere  and my heart beats and labours endlinehere  his dead limbs have coiled every part of my body in tentacles endlinehere  through my ears the waltz jangles endlinehere  like glue his dead body holds me athwart endlinehere  i am drowning in slime endlinehere  and his corpse like a clod beats me into a jelly endlinehere  the chime one endlinehere  and his dead legs keep time endlinehere  the fountain bent and straightened itself in the night wind blowing like a flower endlinehere  it gleamed and glittered a tall white lily under the eye of the golden moon endlinehere  from a stone seat beneath a blossoming lime the man watched it endlinehere  and the spray pattered on the dim grass at his feet endlinehere  the fountain tossed its water up and up like silver marbles endlinehere  is that an arm he sees endlinehere  and for one moment does he catch the moving curve of a thigh endlinehere  the fountain gurgled and splashed and the mans face was wet endlinehere  is it singing that he hears endlinehere  a song of playing at ball endlinehere  the moonlight shines on the straight column of water and through it he sees a woman tossing the water balls endlinehere  her breasts point outwards and the nipples are like buds of peonies endlinehere  her flanks ripple as she plays and the water is not more undulating than the lines of her body endlinehere  am i not more worth than your day ladies covered with awkward stuffs unreal unbeautiful endlinehere  what do you fear in taking me endlinehere  is not the night for poets endlinehere  i am your dream recurrent as water gemmed with the moon endlinehere  she steps to the edge of the pool and the water runs rustling down her sides endlinehere  she stretches out her arms and the fountain streams behind her like an opened veil endlinehere  in the morning the gardeners came to their work endlinehere  there is something in the fountain said one endlinehere  they shuddered as they laid their dead master on the grass endlinehere  i will close his eyes said the head gardener it is uncanny to see a dead man staring at the sun endlinehere  i the inkstand is full of ink and the paper lies white and unspotted in the round of light thrown by a candle endlinehere  puffs of darkness sweep into the corners and keep rolling through the room behind his chair endlinehere  the air is silver and pearl for the night is liquid with moonlight endlinehere  see how the roof glitters like ice endlinehere  over there a slice of yellow cuts into the silver blue and beside it stand two geraniums purple because the light is silver blue to night endlinehere  she is coming the young woman with the bright hair endlinehere  she swings a basket as she walks which she places on the sill between the geranium stalks endlinehere  he laughs and crumples his paper as he leans forward to look endlinehere  the basket filled with moonlight what a title for a book endlinehere  the bellying clouds swing over the housetops endlinehere  he has forgotten the woman in the room with the geraniums endlinehere  he is beating his brain and in his eardrums hammers his heavy pulse endlinehere  she sits on the window sill with the basket in her lap endlinehere  she cracks a nut endlinehere  the shells ricochet upon the roof and get into the gutters and bounce over the edge and disappear endlinehere  it is very queer thinks peter the basket was empty im sure endlinehere  how could nuts appear from the atmosphere endlinehere  the geraniums are very gay in their crimson array endlinehere  the bellying clouds swing over the housetops and over the roofs goes peter to pay his mornings work with a holiday endlinehere  annette it is i endlinehere  peter jumps through the window endlinehere  dear are you alone endlinehere  look peter the dome of the tabernacle is done endlinehere  this gold thread is so very high i am glad it is morning a starry sky would have seen me bankrupt endlinehere  sit down now tell me is your story going well endlinehere  the golden dome glittered in the orange of the setting sun endlinehere  on the walls at intervals hung altar cloths and chasubles and copes and stoles and coffin palls endlinehere  all stiff with rich embroidery and stitched with so much artistry they seemed like spun and woven gems or flower buds new opened on their stems endlinehere  annette looked at the geraniums very red against the blue sky endlinehere  no matter how i try i cannot find any thread of such a red endlinehere  my bleeding hearts drip stuff muddy in comparison endlinehere  see my little pecking dove endlinehere  im in love with my own temple endlinehere  only that halos wrong endlinehere  the colours too strong or not strong enough endlinehere  my eyes are tired endlinehere  oh peter dont be so rough it is valuable endlinehere  i wont do any more endlinehere  you tyrannise dear thats enough endlinehere  now sit down and amuse me while i rest endlinehere  the shadows of the geraniums creep over the floor and begin to climb the opposite wall endlinehere  peter watches her fluid with fatigue floating and drifting and undulant in the orange glow endlinehere  his senses flow towards her where she lies supine and dreaming endlinehere  seeming drowned in a golden halo endlinehere  the pungent smell of the geraniums is hard to bear endlinehere  he pushes against her knees and brushes his lips across her languid hands endlinehere  his lips are hot and speechless endlinehere  he woos her quivering and the room is filled with shadows for the sun has set endlinehere  but she only understands the ways of a needle through delicate stuffs and the shock of one colour on another endlinehere  she does not see that this is the same and querulously murmurs his name endlinehere  peter i dont want it endlinehere  and he the undesired burns and is consumed endlinehere  there is a crescent moon on the rim of the sky endlinehere  iii go home now peter endlinehere  to night is full moon endlinehere  i must be alone endlinehere  how soon the moon is full again endlinehere  annette let me stay endlinehere  indeed dear love i shall not go away endlinehere  my god but you keep me starved endlinehere  you write no entrance here over all the doors endlinehere  is it not strange my dear that loving yet you deny me entrance everywhere endlinehere  would marriage strike you blind or hating bonds as you do why should i be denied the rights of loving if i leave you free endlinehere  you want the whole of me you pick my brains to rest you but you give me not one heart beat endlinehere  oh forgive me sweet endlinehere  i suffer in my loving and you know it endlinehere  i cannot feed my life on being a poet endlinehere  as you please poor peter but it will hurt me if you do endlinehere  it will crush your heart and squeeze the love out endlinehere  he answered gruffly i know what im about endlinehere  only remember one thing from to night endlinehere  my work is taxing and i must have sight endlinehere  the clear moon looks in between the geraniums endlinehere  on the wall the shadow of the man is divided from the shadow of the woman by a silver thread endlinehere  they are eyes hundreds of eyes round like marbles endlinehere  unwinking for there are no lids endlinehere  blue black gray and hazel and the irises are cased in the whites and they glitter and spark under the moon endlinehere  the basket is heaped with human eyes endlinehere  she cracks off the whites and throws them away endlinehere  they ricochet upon the roof and get into the gutters and bounce over the edge and disappear endlinehere  but she is here quietly sitting on the window sill eating human eyes endlinehere  iv how hot the sheets are endlinehere  his skin is tormented with pricks and over him sticks and never moves an eye endlinehere  it lights the sky with blood and drips blood endlinehere  and the drops sizzle on his bare skin and he smells them burning in and branding his body with the name annette endlinehere  the blood red sky is outside his window now endlinehere  and his heart wrenches and pounds annette endlinehere  the lead of the roof is scorching he ricochets gets to the edge bounces over and disappears endlinehere  the bellying clouds are red as they swing over the housetops endlinehere  v the air is of silver and pearl for the night is liquid with moonlight endlinehere  how the ruin glistens like a palace of ice endlinehere  only two black holes swallow the brilliance of the moon endlinehere  deflowered windows sockets without sight endlinehere  a man stands before the house endlinehere  he sees the silver blue moonlight and set in it over his head staring and flickering eyes of geranium red endlinehere  i over the yawning chimney hangs the fog endlinehere  drip hiss drip hiss fall the raindrops on the oaken log which burns and steams and smokes the ceiling beams endlinehere  drip hiss the rain never stops endlinehere  the wide state bed shivers beneath its velvet coverlet endlinehere  above dim in the smoke a tarnished coronet gleams dully endlinehere  overhead hammers and chinks the rain endlinehere  fearfully wails the wind down distant corridors and there comes the swish and sigh of rushes lifted off the floors endlinehere  the arras blows sidewise out from the wall and then falls back again endlinehere  it is my ladys key confided with much nice cunning whisperingly endlinehere  he enters on a sob of wind which gutters the candles almost to swaling endlinehere  the fire flutters and drops endlinehere  he shuts the door endlinehere  the rushes fall again to stillness along the floor endlinehere  outside the wind goes wailing endlinehere  the velvet coverlet of the wide bed is smooth and cold endlinehere  above in the firelight winks the coronet of tarnished gold endlinehere  the knight shivers in his coat of fur and holds out his hands to the withering flame endlinehere  she is always the same a sweet coquette endlinehere  he will wait for her endlinehere  how the log hisses and drips endlinehere  how warm and satisfying will be her lips endlinehere  is it guilt to free a lady from her palsied lord absent and fighting terribly abhorred endlinehere  he stirs a booted heel and kicks a rolling coal endlinehere  his spur clinks on the hearth endlinehere  overhead the rain hammers and chinks endlinehere  she is so pure and whole endlinehere  only because he has her soul will she resign herself to him for where the soul has gone the body must be given as a sign endlinehere  he takes her by the divine right of the only lover endlinehere  he has sworn to fight her lord and wed her after endlinehere  should he be overborne she will die adoring him forlorn shriven by her great love endlinehere  above the coronet winks in the darkness endlinehere  drip hiss fall the raindrops endlinehere  the arras blows out from the wall and a door bangs in a far off hall endlinehere  the candles swale endlinehere  in the gale the moat below plunges and spatters endlinehere  will the lady lose courage and not come endlinehere  the rain claps on a loosened rafter endlinehere  is that laughter endlinehere  the room is filled with lisps and whispers endlinehere  one candle drowns and the other gutters endlinehere  is that the rain which pads and patters is it the wind through the winding entries which chatters endlinehere  the state bed is very cold and he is alone endlinehere  how far from the wall the arras is blown endlinehere  it is no storm which makes these little chuckling sounds endlinehere  by the great wounds of holy jesus it is his dear lady kissing and clasping someone endlinehere  through the sobbing storm he hears her love take form and flutter out in words endlinehere  they prick into his ears and stun his desire which lies within him hard and dead like frozen fire endlinehere  and the little noise never stops endlinehere  he tears down the arras from before an inner chambers bolted door endlinehere  ii the state bed shivers in the watery dawn endlinehere  for the storm never stops endlinehere  on the velvet coverlet lie two bodies stripped and fair in the cold grey air endlinehere  drip hiss fall the blood drops for the bleeding never stops endlinehere  at each side of the bed on the floor is a head endlinehere  a mans on this side a womans on that and the red blood oozes along the rush mat endlinehere  a wisp of paper is twisted carefully into the strands of the dead mans hair endlinehere  it says my lord your wifes paramour has paid with his life for the high favour endlinehere  through the ladys silver fillet is wound another paper endlinehere  it reads most noble lord your wifes misdeeds are as a double stranded necklace of beads endlinehere  but i have engaged that on your return she shall welcome you here endlinehere  she will not spurn your love as before you have still the best part of her endlinehere  her blood was red her body white they will both be here for your delight endlinehere  the soul inside was a lump of dirt i have rid you of that with a spurt of my sword point endlinehere  good luck to your pleasure endlinehere  she will be quite complaisant my friend i wager endlinehere  the end was a splashed flourish of ink endlinehere  in the passage is heard the clink of armour the tread of a heavy man endlinehere  the door bursts open and standing there his thin hair wavering in the glare of steely daylight is my lord of clair endlinehere  over the yawning chimney hangs the fog endlinehere  overhead hammers and chinks the rain which never stops endlinehere  the velvet coverlet is sodden and wet yet the roof beams are tight endlinehere  overhead the coronet gleams with its blackened gold winking and blinking endlinehere  among the rushes three corpses are growing cold endlinehere  iii in the castle church you may see them stand two sumptuous tombs on either hand of the choir my lords and my ladys grand in sculptured filigrees endlinehere  and where the transepts of the church expand a crusader come from the holy land lies with crossed legs and embroidered band endlinehere  the pages name became a brand for shame endlinehere  he was buried in crawling sand after having been burnt by royal command endlinehere  the bell in the convent tower swung endlinehere  high overhead the great sun hung a navel for the curving sky endlinehere  the air was a blue clarity endlinehere  swallows flew and a cock crew endlinehere  the iron clanging sank through the light air rustled over with blowing branches endlinehere  a flare of spotted green and a snake had gone into the bed where the snowdrops shone in green new started their white bells parted endlinehere  two by two in a long brown line the nuns were walking to breathe the fine bright april air endlinehere  they must go in soon and work at their tasks all the afternoon endlinehere  but this time is theirs endlinehere  they walk in pairs endlinehere  first comes the abbess preoccupied and slow as a woman often tried with her temper in bond endlinehere  then the oldest nun endlinehere  then younger and younger until the last one has a laugh on her lips and fairly skips endlinehere  they wind about the gravel walks and all the long line buzzes and talks endlinehere  they step in time to the ringing bell with scarcely a shadow endlinehere  the sun is well in the core of a sky domed silverly endlinehere  sister marguerite said the pears will soon bud endlinehere  sister angelique said she must get her spud and free the earth round the jasmine roots endlinehere  sister veronique said oh look at those shoots endlinehere  theres a crocus up with a purple cup endlinehere  but sister clotilde said nothing at all she looked up and down the old grey wall to see if a lizard were basking there endlinehere  she looked across the garden to where a sycamore flanked the garden door endlinehere  she was restless although her little feet danced and quite unsatisfied for it chanced her mornings work had hung in her mind and would not take form endlinehere  she could not find the beautifulness for the virgins dress endlinehere  should it be of pink or damasked blue endlinehere  or perhaps lilac with gold shotted through endlinehere  should it be banded with yellow and white roses or sparked like a frosty night endlinehere  or a crimson sheen over some sort of green endlinehere  but clotildes eyes saw nothing new in all the garden no single hue so lovely or so marvellous that its use would not seem impious endlinehere  so on she walked and the others talked endlinehere  sister elisabeth edged away from what her companion had to say for sister marthe saw the world in little she weighed every grain and recorded each tittle endlinehere  she did plain stitching and worked in the kitchen endlinehere  sister radegonde knows the apples wont last i told her so this friday past endlinehere  i must speak to her before compline endlinehere  her words were like dust motes in slanting sunshine endlinehere  the other nun sighed with her pleasure quite dried endlinehere  suddenly sister berthe cried out the snowdrops are blooming endlinehere  they turned about endlinehere  the little white cups bent over the ground and in among the light stems wound a crested snake with his eyes awake endlinehere  his crest was amber glittered with blue and opaque so the sun came shining through endlinehere  it seemed a crown with fiery points endlinehere  when he quivered all down his scaly joints from every slot the sparkles shot endlinehere  the nuns huddled tightly together fear catching their senses endlinehere  but clotilde must peer more closely at the beautiful snake she seemed entranced and eased endlinehere  could she make colours so rare the dress were there endlinehere  the abbess shook off her lethargy endlinehere  sisters we will walk on said she endlinehere  sidling away from the snowdrop bed the line curved forwards the abbess ahead endlinehere  only clotilde was the last to yield endlinehere  when the recreation hour was done each went in to her task endlinehere  alone in the library with its great north light clotilde wrought at an exquisite wreath of flowers for her book of hours endlinehere  they framed the picture she had made half delighted and half afraid endlinehere  in a courtyard with a lozenged floor the virgin watched and through the arched door the angel came like a springing flame endlinehere  his wings were dipped in violet fire his limbs were strung to holy desire endlinehere  he lowered his head and passed under the arch and the air seemed beating a solemn march endlinehere  the virgin waited with eyes dilated endlinehere  her face was quiet and innocent and beautiful with her strange assent endlinehere  a silver thread about her head her halo was poised endlinehere  but in the stead of her gown there remained the vellum unstained endlinehere  clotilde painted the flowers patiently lingering over each tint and dye endlinehere  she could spend great pains now she had seen that curious unimagined green endlinehere  a colour so strange it had seemed to change endlinehere  she thought it had altered while she gazed endlinehere  at first it had been simple green then glazed all over with twisting flames each spot a molten colour trembling and hot and every eye seemed to liquefy endlinehere  she had made a plan and her spirits danced endlinehere  after all she had only glanced at that wonderful snake and she must know just what hues made the creature throw those splashes and sprays of prismed rays endlinehere  when evening prayers were sung and said the nuns lit their tapers and went to bed endlinehere  and soon in the convent there was no light for the moon did not rise until late that night only the shine of the lamp at the shrine endlinehere  clotilde lay still in her trembling sheets endlinehere  her heart shook her body with its beats endlinehere  she could not see till the moon should rise so she whispered prayers and kept her eyes on the window square till light should be there endlinehere  the faintest shadow of a branch fell on the floor endlinehere  clotilde grown staunch with solemn purpose softly rose and fluttered down between the rows of sleeping nuns endlinehere  she almost runs endlinehere  she must go out through the little side door lest the nuns who were always praying before the virgins altar should hear her pass endlinehere  she pushed the bolts and over the grass the red moons brim mounted its rim endlinehere  her shadow crept up the convent wall as she swiftly left it over all the garden lay the level glow of a moon coming up very big and slow endlinehere  the gravel glistened endlinehere  she stopped and listened endlinehere  it was still and the moonlight was getting clearer endlinehere  she laughed a little but she felt queerer than ever before endlinehere  the snowdrop bed was reached and she bent down her head endlinehere  on the striped ground the snake was wound endlinehere  for a moment clotilde paused in alarm then she rolled up her sleeve and stretched out her arm endlinehere  she thought she heard steps she must be quick endlinehere  she darted her hand out and seized the thick wriggling slime only just in time endlinehere  the old gardener came muttering down the path and his shadow fell like a broad black swath and covered clotilde and the angry snake endlinehere  he bit her but what difference did that make endlinehere  the virgin should dress in his loveliness endlinehere  the gardener was covering his new set plants for the night was chilly and nothing daunts your lover of growing things endlinehere  he spied something to do and turned aside and the moonlight streamed on clotilde and gleamed endlinehere  his business finished the gardener rose endlinehere  he shook and swore for the moonlight shows a girl with a fire tongued serpent she grasping him laughing while quietly her eyes are weeping endlinehere  is he sleeping endlinehere  he thinks it is some holy vision brushes that aside and with decision jumps and hits the snake with his stick crushes his spine and then with quick urgent command takes her hand endlinehere  the gardener sucks the poison and spits cursing and praying as befits a poor old man half out of his wits endlinehere  whatever possessed you sister its hatched of a devil and very evil endlinehere  its one of them horrid basilisks you read about endlinehere  they say a man risks his life to touch it but i guess ive sucked it out by now endlinehere  lucky i chucked it away from you endlinehere  he is dead now but his colours wont fade at once and by noon i shall have made the virgins robe endlinehere  oh francois see how kindly the moon shines down on me endlinehere  i cant die yet for the task was set endlinehere  you wont die now for ive sucked it away grumbled old francois so have your play endlinehere  if the virgin is set on snakes colours so strong francois dont say things like that it is wrong endlinehere  so clotilde vented her creed endlinehere  he cant do no more harm sister said he endlinehere  paint as much as you like endlinehere  and gingerly he picked up the snake with his stick endlinehere  clotilde thanked him and begged that he would shield her secret though itching to talk in the kitchen endlinehere  at dawns first saffron spired warning clotilde was up endlinehere  and all that morning except when she went to the chapel to pray she painted and when the april day was hot with sun clotilde had done endlinehere  she drooped though her heart beat loud at the beauty before her and her spirit bowed to the virgin her finely touched thought had made endlinehere  a lady in excellence arrayed and wonder souled endlinehere  from long fasting clotilde felt weary and faint but her eyes were starred like those of a saint enmeshed in heavens beatitude endlinehere  a sudden clamour hurled its rude force to break her vision awake endlinehere  the door nearly leapt from its hinges pushed by the multitude of nuns endlinehere  they hushed when they saw clotilde in perfect quiet smiling a little perplexed at the riot endlinehere  and all the hive buzzed shes alive endlinehere  he had found the strain of silence too great and preferred the pain of a conscience outraged endlinehere  the news had spread and all were convinced clotilde must be dead endlinehere  for francois to spite them had not seen fit to right them endlinehere  how could we have guessed our convent so blessed endlinehere  to have you die endlinehere  and i who am a hollow living shell the grave is empty of me endlinehere  holy mary i crave to be taken dear mother instead of this other endlinehere  she dropped on her knees and silently prayed with anguished hands and tears delayed to a painful slowness endlinehere  the minutes drew to fractions endlinehere  then the west wind blew the sound of a bell on a gusty swell endlinehere  it came skipping over the slates of the roof and the bright bell notes seemed a reproof to grief in the eye of so fair a day endlinehere  the abbess comforted ceased to pray endlinehere  and the sun lit the flowers in clotildes book of hours endlinehere  it glistened the green of the virgins dress and made the red spots in a flushed excess pulse and start and the violet wings of the angel were colour which shines and sings endlinehere  the book seemed a choir of rainbow fire endlinehere  the abbess crossed herself and each nun did the same then one by one they filed to the chapel that incensed prayers might plead for the life of this sister of theirs endlinehere  clotilde the inspired endlinehere  she only felt tired endlinehere  the old chronicles say she did not die until heavy with years endlinehere  and that is why there hangs in the convent church a basket of osiered silver a holy casket and treasured therein a dried snake skin endlinehere  panels of claret and blue which shine under the moon like lees of wine endlinehere  a coronet done in a golden scroll and wheels which blunder and creak as they roll through the muddy ruts of a moorland track endlinehere  they darent look back endlinehere  they are whipping and cursing the horses endlinehere  what brutes men are when they think theyre scored endlinehere  they are scared half out of their wits poor souls endlinehere  for my lord has a casket full of rolls of minted sovereigns and silver bars endlinehere  i laugh to think how hell show his scars in london to morrow endlinehere  he whines with rage in his varnished cage endlinehere  my lady has shoved her rings over her toes endlinehere  tis an ancient trick every night rider knows endlinehere  but i shall relieve her of them yet when i see she limps in the minuet i must beg to celebrate this night and the green moonlight endlinehere  theres nothing to hurry about the plain is hours long and the muds a strain endlinehere  my geldings uncommonly strong in the loins in half an hour ill bag the coins endlinehere  tis a clear sweet night on the turn of spring endlinehere  the chase is the thing endlinehere  how the coach flashes and wobbles the moon dripping down so quietly on it endlinehere  a tune is beating out of the curses and screams and the cracking all through the painted seams endlinehere  steady old horse well keep it in sight endlinehere  tis a rare fine night endlinehere  theres a clump of trees on the dip of the down and the sky shimmers where it hangs over the town endlinehere  it seems a shame to break the air in two with this pistol but ive my share of drudgery like other men endlinehere  hold up you beast now what the devil endlinehere  confound this moor for a pockholed evil rotten marsh endlinehere  my right legs snapped endlinehere  tis a mercy hes rolled but im nicely capped endlinehere  a broken legged man and a broken legged horse endlinehere  theyll get me of course endlinehere  the cursed coach will reach the town and theyll all come out every loafer grown a lion to handcuff a man thats down endlinehere  oh the coachmans bulleted hat endlinehere  ill give it a head to fit it pat endlinehere  _they handcuffed the body just for style and they hung him in chains for the volatile wind to scour him flesh from bones endlinehere  way out on the moor you can hear the groans his gibbet makes when it blows a gale endlinehere  tis a common tale endlinehere  _ paul jannes was working very late for this watch must be done by eight to morrow or the cardinal would certainly be vexed endlinehere  so they picked his pocket and he paid in jewels for his slobbering kisses endlinehere  this watch was made to buy him blisses from an austrian countess on her way home and she meant to start next day endlinehere  paul worked by the pointed tulip flame of a tallow candle and became so absorbed that his old clock made him wince striking the hour a moment since endlinehere  its echo only half apprehended lingered about the room endlinehere  he ended screwing the little rubies in setting the wheels to lock and spin curling the infinitesimal springs fixing the filigree hands endlinehere  chippings of precious stones lay strewn about endlinehere  the table before him was a rout of splashes and sparks of coloured light endlinehere  there was yellow gold in sheets and quite a heap of emeralds and steel endlinehere  here was a gem there was a wheel endlinehere  and glasses lay like limpid lakes shining and still and there were flakes of silver and shavings of pearl and little wires all awhirl with the light of the candle endlinehere  he took the watch and wound its hands about to match the time then glanced up to take the hour from the hanging clock endlinehere  good merciful power endlinehere  how came that shadow on the wall no woman was in the room endlinehere  his tall chiffonier stood gaunt behind his chair endlinehere  his old cloak rabbit lined hung from a peg endlinehere  the door was closed endlinehere  just for a moment he must have dozed endlinehere  he looked again and saw it plain endlinehere  the silhouette made a blue black stain on the opposite wall and it never wavered even when the candle quavered under his panting breath endlinehere  what made that beautiful dreadful thing that shade of something so lovely so exquisite cast from a substance which the sight had not been tutored to perceive endlinehere  paul brushed his eyes across his sleeve endlinehere  clear cut the shadow on the wall gleamed black and never moved at all endlinehere  pauls watches were like amulets wrought into patterns and rosettes the cases were all set with stones and wreathing lines and shining zones endlinehere  he knew the beauty in a curve and the shadow tortured every nerve with its perfect rhythm of outline cutting the whitewashed wall endlinehere  so fine was the neck he knew he could have spanned it about with the fingers of one hand endlinehere  the lady was edged with the stamp of race endlinehere  a singular vision in such a place endlinehere  he moved the candle to the tall chiffonier the shadow stayed on the wall endlinehere  he threw his cloak upon a chair and still the ladys face was there endlinehere  from every corner of the room he saw in the patch of light the gloom that was the lady endlinehere  her violet bloom was almost brighter than that which came from his candles tulip flame endlinehere  he set the filigree hands he laid the watch in the case which he had made he put on his rabbit cloak and snuffed his candle out endlinehere  the room seemed stuffed with darkness endlinehere  softly he crossed the floor and let himself out through the door endlinehere  the sun was flashing from every pin and wheel when paul let himself in endlinehere  the whitewashed walls were hot with light endlinehere  the room was the core of a chrysolite burning and shimmering with fiery might endlinehere  the sun was so bright that no shadow could fall from the furniture upon the wall endlinehere  paul sighed as he looked at the empty space where a glare usurped the ladys place endlinehere  he settled himself to his work but his mind wandered and he would wake to find his hand suspended his eyes grown dim and nothing advanced beyond the rim of his dreaming endlinehere  the cardinal sent to pay for his watch which had purchased so fine a day endlinehere  but paul could hardly touch the gold it seemed the price of his shadow sold endlinehere  with the first twilight he struck a match and watched the little blue stars hatch into an egg of perfect flame endlinehere  he lit his candle and almost in shame at his eagerness lifted his eyes endlinehere  the shadow was there and its precise outline etched the cold white wall endlinehere  the young man swore by god endlinehere  you paul theres something the matter with your brain endlinehere  go home now and sleep off the strain endlinehere  the next day was a storm the rain whispered and scratched at the window pane endlinehere  a grey and shadowless morning filled the little shop endlinehere  the watches chilled were dead and sparkless as burnt out coals endlinehere  the gems lay on the table like shoals of stranded shells their colours faded mere heaps of stone dull and degraded endlinehere  pauls head was heavy his hands obeyed no orders for his fancy strayed endlinehere  his work became a simple round of watches repaired and watches wound endlinehere  the slanting ribbons of the rain broke themselves on the window pane but paul saw the silver lines in vain endlinehere  in the morning he selected all his perfect jacinths endlinehere  when at dusk the shadow grew upon the wall pauls work was through endlinehere  holding the watch he spoke to her lady beautiful shadow stir into one brief sign of being endlinehere  turn your eyes this way and seeing this watch made from those sweet curves where your hair from your forehead swerves accept the gift which i have wrought with your fairness in my thought endlinehere  grant me this and i shall be honoured overwhelmingly endlinehere  the shadow rested black and still and the wind sighed over the window sill endlinehere  topazes ran in a foamy stream over the cover the hands were studded with garnets and seemed red roses budded endlinehere  the face was of crystal and engraved upon it the figures flashed and waved with zircons and beryls and amethysts endlinehere  it took a week to make and his trysts at night with the shadow were his alone endlinehere  paul swore not to speak till his task was done endlinehere  the night that the jewel was worthy to give endlinehere  paul watched the long hours of daylight live to the faintest streak then lit his light and sharp against the walls pure white the outline of the shadow started into form endlinehere  his burning hearted words so long imprisoned swelled to tumbling speech endlinehere  like one compelled he told the lady all his love and holding out the watch above his head he knelt imploring some littlest sign endlinehere  the shadow was dumb endlinehere  weeks passed paul worked in fevered haste and everything he made he placed before his lady endlinehere  the shadow kept its perfect passiveness endlinehere  he wooed her with the work of his hands he waited for those dear commands she never gave endlinehere  no word no motion eased the ache of his devotion endlinehere  his days passed in a strain of toil his nights burnt up in a seething coil endlinehere  seasons shot by uncognisant he worked endlinehere  the shadow came to haunt even his days endlinehere  sometimes quite plain he saw on the wall the blackberry stain of his ladys picture endlinehere  no sun was bright enough to dazzle that from his sight endlinehere  then he would curse himself and her endlinehere  and more the beauty he could not make and give her for her comforts sake endlinehere  he would beat his weary empty hands upon the table would hold up strands of silver and gold and ask her why she scorned the best which he could buy endlinehere  he would pray as to some high niched saint that she would cure him of the taint of failure endlinehere  he would clutch the wall with his bleeding fingers if she should fall he could catch and hold her and make her live endlinehere  with sobs he would ask her to forgive all he had done endlinehere  and broken spent he would call himself impertinent presumptuous a tradesman a nothing driven to madness by the sight of heaven endlinehere  there were days when he wooed as a lover sighed in tenderness spoke to his bride urged her to patience said his skill should break the spell endlinehere  a mans sworn will could compass life even that he knew endlinehere  he would prove it true endlinehere  the edge of the shadow never blurred endlinehere  the lips of the shadow never stirred endlinehere  he would climb on chairs to reach her lips and pat her hair with his finger tips endlinehere  then deadly sick he would lie in a swoon for hours while thick phantasmagoria crowded his brain and his body shrieked in the clutch of pain endlinehere  the crisis passed he would wake and smile with a vacant joy half imbecile and quite confused not being certain why he was suffering a curtain fallen over the tortured mind beguiled his sorrow endlinehere  like a little child he would play with his watches and gems with glee calling the shadow to look and see how the spots on the ceiling danced prettily when he flashed his stones endlinehere  mother the green has slid so cunningly in between the blue and the yellow endlinehere  oh please look down endlinehere  one morning he threw the street door wide on coming in and his vigorous stride made the tools on his table rattle and jump endlinehere  in his hands he carried a new burst clump of laurel blossoms whose smooth barked stalks were pliant with sap endlinehere  as a husband talks to the wife he left an hour ago paul spoke to the shadow endlinehere  dear you know to day the calendar calls it spring and i woke this morning gathering asphodels in my dreams for you endlinehere  so i rushed out to see what flowers blew their pink and purple scented souls across the town winds dusty scrolls and made the approach to the market square a garden with smells and sunny air endlinehere  i feel so well and happy to day i think i shall take a holiday endlinehere  and to night we will have a little treat endlinehere  i am going to bring you something to eat endlinehere  he looked at the shadow anxiously endlinehere  it was quite grave and silent endlinehere  he shut the outer door and came and leant against the window frame endlinehere  dearest he said we live apart although i bear you in my heart endlinehere  we look out each from a different world endlinehere  at any moment we may be hurled asunder endlinehere  they follow their orbits we obey their laws entirely endlinehere  now you must come or i go there unless we are willing to live the flare of a lighted instant and have it gone endlinehere  a bee in the laurels began to drone endlinehere  a loosened petal fluttered prone endlinehere  man grows by eating if you eat you will be filled with our life sweet will be our planet in your mouth endlinehere  if not i must parch in deaths wide drouth until i gain to where you are and give you myself in whatever star may happen endlinehere  is it not ordered cleverly endlinehere  the shadow bloomed like a plum and clear hung in the sunlight endlinehere  it did not hear endlinehere  paul slipped away as the dusk began to dim the little shop endlinehere  he ran to the nearest inn and chose with care as much as his thin purse could bear endlinehere  returning he brushed his tools aside and laid across the table a wide napkin endlinehere  he put a glass and plate on either side in duplicate endlinehere  over the ladys excellent with loveliness the laurels bent endlinehere  in the centre the white flaked pastry stood and beside it the wine flask endlinehere  red as blood was the wine which should bring the lustihood of human life to his ladys veins endlinehere  he put meat on her plate and filled her glass and waited what should come to pass endlinehere  the shadow lay quietly on the wall endlinehere  from the street outside came a watchmans call a cloudy night endlinehere  rain beginning to fall endlinehere  and still he waited endlinehere  the clocks slow tick knocked on the silence endlinehere  he filled his own glass full of wine from his pocket he took a paper endlinehere  the twine was knotted and he searched a knife from his jumbled tools endlinehere  the cord of life snapped as he cut the little string endlinehere  he knew that he must do the thing he feared endlinehere  he shook powder into the wine and holding it up so the candles shine sparked a ruby through its heart he drank it endlinehere  dear never apart again endlinehere  you have said it was mine to do endlinehere  it is done and i am come to you endlinehere  paul jannes let the empty wine glass fall and held out his arms endlinehere  the insentient wall stared down at him with its cold white glare unstained endlinehere  the shadow was not there endlinehere  paul clutched and tore at his tightening throat endlinehere  he felt the veins in his body bloat and the hot blood run like fire and stones along the sides of his cracking bones endlinehere  but he laughed as he staggered towards the door and he laughed aloud as he sank on the floor endlinehere  the coroner took the body away and the watches were sold that saturday endlinehere  the auctioneer said one could seldom buy such watches and the prices were high endlinehere  holy mother

mother what is it that sings endlinehere  i hear voices singing and lovely silver trumpets through it all endlinehere  they seem just on the other side of the wall endlinehere  let me keep my baby holy mother endlinehere  he is only a poor lace makers baby with a stain upon him but give me strength to bring him up to be a man endlinehere  tang of fruitage in the air red boughs bursting everywhere shimmering of seeded grass hooded gentians all amass endlinehere  warmth of earth and cloudless wind tearing off the husky rind blowing feathered seeds to fall by the sun baked sheltering wall endlinehere  beech trees in a golden haze hardy sumachs all ablaze glowing through the silver birches endlinehere  how that pine tree shouts and lurches endlinehere  from the sunny door jamb high swings the shell of a butterfly endlinehere  scrape of insect violins through the stubble shrilly dins endlinehere  every blades a minaret where a small muezzins set loudly calling us to pray at the miracle of day endlinehere  then the purple lidded night westering comes her footsteps light guided by the radiant boon of a sickle shaped new moon endlinehere  in the brown water thick and silver sheened in the sunshine liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds a pike dozed endlinehere  lost among the shadows of stems he lay unnoticed endlinehere  suddenly he flicked his tail and a green and copper brightness ran under the water endlinehere  out from under the reeds came the olive green light and orange flashed up through the sun thickened water endlinehere  so the fish passed across the pool green and copper a darkness and a gleam and the blurred reflections of the willows on the opposite bank received it endlinehere  where is she the woman who wore it endlinehere  the scent of her lingers and drugs me endlinehere  a languor fire shotted runs through me and i crush the scarf down on my face and gulp in the warmth and the blueness and my eyes swim in cool tinted heavens endlinehere  around me are columns of marble and a diapered sun flickered pavement endlinehere  rose leaves blow and patter against it endlinehere  below the stone steps a lute tinkles endlinehere  a jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor endlinehere  a big bellied frog hops through the sunlight and plops in the gold bubbled water of a basin sunk in the black and white marble endlinehere  the west wind has lifted a scarf on the seat close beside me the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour endlinehere  she draws it more closely about her and it ripples beneath her slight stirring endlinehere  how loud clocks can tick when a room is empty and one is alone endlinehere  my daffodil crowned slim and without sandals endlinehere  as the sudden spurt of flame upon darkness so my eyeballs are startled with you supple limbed youth among the fruit trees light runner through tasselled orchards endlinehere  you are an almond flower unsheathed leaping and flickering between the budded branches endlinehere  as i would free the white almond from the green husk so would i strip your trappings off beloved endlinehere  and fingering the smooth and polished kernel i should see that in my hands glittered a gem beyond counting endlinehere  the neighbour sits in his window and plays the flute endlinehere  from my bed i can hear him and the round notes flutter and tap about the room and hit against each other blurring to unexpected chords endlinehere  it is very beautiful with the little flute notes all about me in the darkness endlinehere  in the daytime the neighbour eats bread and onions with one hand and copies music with the other endlinehere  he is fat and has a bald head so i do not look at him but run quickly past his window endlinehere  there is always the sky to look at or the water in the well endlinehere  but when night comes and he plays his flute i think of him as a young man with gold seals hanging from his watch and a blue coat with silver buttons endlinehere  you are beautiful and faded like an old opera tune played upon a harpsichord or like the sun flooded silks of an eighteenth century boudoir endlinehere  in your eyes smoulder the fallen roses of out lived minutes and the perfume of your soul is vague and suffusing with the pungence of sealed spice jars endlinehere  your half tones delight me and i grow mad with gazing at your blent colours endlinehere  my vigour is a new minted penny which i cast at your feet endlinehere  gather it up from the dust that its sparkle may amuse you endlinehere  damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone where trickle and plash the fountains marble fountains yellowed with much water endlinehere  splashing down moss tarnished steps it falls the water and the air is throbbing with it endlinehere  with its gurgling and running endlinehere  with its leaping and deep cool murmur endlinehere  and i wished for night and you endlinehere  i wanted to see you in the swimming pool white and shining in the silver flecked water endlinehere  while the moon rode over the garden high in the arch of night and the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness endlinehere  night and the water and you in your whiteness bathing endlinehere  guarded within the old red walls embrace marshalled like soldiers in gay company the tulips stand arrayed endlinehere  here infantry wheels out into the sunlight endlinehere  what bold grace sets off their tunics white with crimson lace endlinehere  here are platoons of gold frocked cavalry with scarlet sabres tossing in the eye of purple batteries every gun in place endlinehere  forward they come with flaunting colours spread with torches burning stepping out in time to some quick unheard march endlinehere  our ears are dead we cannot catch the tune endlinehere  in pantomime parades that army endlinehere  with our utmost powers we hear the wind stream through a bed of flowers endlinehere  as a monk who prays changed to there are none ever endlinehere  as a monk who prays a tale of starvation and he neither eat nor drank endlinehere  changed to and he neither ate nor drank endlinehere  the great adventure of max breuck stanza headings were originally roman numerals endlinehere  and terror wingd steps endlinehere  before the altar bowed he stands with empty hands upon it perfumed offerings burn wreathing with smoke the sacrificial urn endlinehere  his sole condition love and poverty endlinehere  shining and distant goddess hear my prayer where you swim in the high air endlinehere  with charity look down on me under this tree tending the gifts i have not brought the rare and goodly things i have not sought endlinehere  instead take from me all my life endlinehere  upon the wings of shimmering moonbeams i pack my poets dreams for you endlinehere  my wearying strife my courage my loss into the night i toss for you endlinehere  golden divinity deign to look down on me who so unworthily offers to you all life has known seeds withered unsown hopes turning quick to fears laughter which dies in tears endlinehere  the shredded remnant of a man is all the span and compass of my offering to you endlinehere  empty and silent i kneel before your pure calm majesty endlinehere  on this stone in this urn i pour my heart and watch it burn myself the sacrifice but be still unmoved divinity endlinehere  from the altar bathed in moonlight the smoke rose straight in the quiet night endlinehere  wild little bird who chose thee for a sign to put upon the cover of this book endlinehere  who heard thee singing in the distance dim the vague far greenness of the enshrouding wood when the damp freshness of the morning earth was full of pungent sweetness and thy song endlinehere  we do not know what bird thou art endlinehere  perhaps that fairy bird fabled in island tale who never sings but once and then his song is of such fearful beauty that he dies from sheer exuberance of melody endlinehere  for this they took thee little bird for this they captured thee tilting among the leaves and stamped thee for a symbol on this book endlinehere  for it contains a song surpassing thine richer more sweet more poignant endlinehere  glinting golden through the trees apples of hesperides endlinehere  through the moon pierced warp of night shoot pale shafts of yellow light swaying to the kissing breeze swings the treasure golden gleaming apples of hesperides endlinehere  far and lofty yet they glimmer apples of hesperides endlinehere  blinded by their radiant shimmer pushing forward just for these dew besprinkled bramble marred poor duped mortal travel scarred always thinking soon to seize and possess the golden glistening apples of hesperides endlinehere  orbed and glittering and pendent apples of hesperides endlinehere  not one missing still transcendent clustering like a swarm of bees endlinehere  yielding to no mans desire glowing with a saffron fire splendid unassailed the golden apples of hesperides endlinehere  april had covered the hills with flickering yellows and reds the sparkle and coolness of snow was blown from the mountain beds endlinehere  across a deep sunken stream the pink of blossoming trees and from windless appleblooms the humming of many bees endlinehere  the air was of rose and gold arabesqued with the song of birds who swinging unseen under leaves made music more eager than words endlinehere  of a sudden aslant the road a brightness to dazzle and stun a glint of the bluest blue a flash from a sapphire sun endlinehere  blue birds so blue t was a dream an impossible unconceived hue the high sky of summer dropped down some rapturous ocean to woo endlinehere  such a colour such infinite light endlinehere  the heart of a fabulous gem many faceted brilliant and rare endlinehere  centre stone of the earths diadem endlinehere  centre stone of the crown of the world sincerity graved on your youth endlinehere  and your eyes hold the blue bird flash the sapphire shaft which is truth endlinehere  life is a stream on which we strew petal by petal the flower of our heart the end lost in dream they float past our view we only watch their glad early start endlinehere  freighted with hope crimsoned with joy we scatter the leaves of our opening rose their widening scope their distant employ we never shall know endlinehere  and the stream as it flows sweeps them away each one is gone ever beyond into infinite ways endlinehere  we alone stay while years hurry on the flower fared forth though its fragrance still stays endlinehere  so through the vacancy of busy life at intervals you cross my path and bring the deep solemnity of passing years endlinehere  for you i have shed bitter tears for you i have relinquished that for which my heart cried out in selfish longing endlinehere  and to night having just left you i can say t is well endlinehere  thank god that i have known a soul so true so nobly just so worthy to be loved endlinehere  stupefy my heart to every days monotony seal up my eyes i would not look so far chasten my steps to peaceful regularity bow down my head lest i behold a star endlinehere  fill my days with work a thousand calm necessities leaving no moment to consecrate to hope girdle my thoughts within the dull circumferences of facts which form the actual in one short hours scope endlinehere  give me dreamless sleep and loose nights power over me shut my ears to sounds only tumultuous then bid fancy slumber and steal away its potency or nature wakes and strives to live again endlinehere  let each day pass well ordered in its usefulness unlit by sunshine unscarred by storm dower me with strength and curb all foolish eagerness the law exacts obedience endlinehere  high up above the open welcoming door it hangs a piece of wood with colours dim endlinehere  once long ago it was a waving tree and knew the sun and shadow through the leaves of forest trees in a thick eastern wood endlinehere  dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among its branches breaking here and there a limb but every now and then broad sunlit days lovingly lingered caught among the leaves endlinehere  an artist once with patient careful knife had fashioned it like to the untamed sea endlinehere  here waves uprear themselves their tops blown back by the gay sunny wind which whips the blue and breaks it into gleams and sparks of light endlinehere  among the flashing waves are two white birds which swoop and soar and scream for very joy at the wild sport endlinehere  now diving quickly in questing some glistening fish endlinehere  now flying up their dripping feathers shining in the sun while the wet drops like little glints of light fall pattering backward to the parent sea endlinehere  gliding along the green and foam flecked hollows or skimming some white crest about to break the spirits of the sky deigning to stoop and play with ocean in a summer mood endlinehere  when you my dear are away away how wearily goes the creeping day endlinehere  a year drags after morning and night starts another year of candle light endlinehere  o pausing sun and lingering moon endlinehere  grant me i beg of you this boon endlinehere  whirl round the earth as never sun has his diurnal journey run endlinehere  and moon slip past the ladders of air in a single flash while your streaming hair catches the stars and pulls them down to shine on some slumbering chinese town endlinehere  o kindly sun endlinehere  bring evening to crowd the footsteps of noon endlinehere  but when that long awaited day hangs ripe in the heavens your voyaging stay endlinehere  be morning o sun endlinehere  with the lark in song be afternoon for ages long endlinehere  and moon let you and your lesser lights watch over a century of nights endlinehere  here terrace sinks to terrace arbors close the ends of dreaming paths a wanton wind jostles the half ripe pears and then unkind tumbles a slumber in a pillar rose with content grown indolent endlinehere  by night my garden is oerhung with gems fixed in an onyx setting endlinehere  fireflies flicker their lanterns in my dazzled eyes endlinehere  in serried rows i guess the straight stiff stems of hollyhocks against the rocks endlinehere  who shall declare the joy of the running endlinehere  who shall tell of the pleasures of flight endlinehere  springing and spurning the tufts of wild heather sweeping wide winged through the blue dome of light endlinehere  everything mortal has moments immortal swift and god gifted immeasurably bright endlinehere  joy in the touch of the wind and the sunlight endlinehere  with the vigorous earth i am one endlinehere  to be a flower nodding in the sun bending then upspringing as the breezes run holding up a scent brimmed cup full of summers fragrance to the summer sun endlinehere  to be a butterfly still upon a flower winking with its painted wings happy in the hour endlinehere  blossoms hold mines of gold deep within the farthest heart of each chaliced flower endlinehere  to be a cloud blowing through the blue shadowing the mountains rushing loudly through valleys deep where torrents keep always their plunging thunder and their misty arch of blue endlinehere  to be a wave splintering on the sand drawing back but leaving lingeringly the land endlinehere  rainbow light flashes bright telling tales of coral caves half hid in yellow sand endlinehere  soon they die the flowers insects live a day clouds dissolve in showers only waves at play last forever endlinehere  shall endeavor make a sea of purpose mightier than we dream to day endlinehere  he whistled a little frivolous tune which he felt to be pulsing with ecstasy for he thought that success always followed desire such a very superlative fool was he endlinehere  a maiden came by on an ambling mule her gown was rose red and her kerchief blue on her lap she carried a basket of eggs endlinehere  thought the fool there is certainly room for two endlinehere  so he jauntily swaggered towards the maid and put out his hand to the bridle rein endlinehere  my pretty girl quoth the fool take me up for to ride with you to the town i am fain endlinehere  but the maiden struck at his upraised arm and pelted him hotly with eggs a score endlinehere  the mule lashed into a fury ran the fool went back to his stone and swore endlinehere  then out of the cloud of settling dust the burly form of an abbot appeared reading his office he rode to the town endlinehere  and the fool got up for his heart was cheered endlinehere  he stood in the midst of the long white road and swept off his cap till it touched the ground endlinehere  ah reverent sir well met said the fool a worthier transport never was found endlinehere  i pray you allow me to mount with you your palfrey seems both sturdy and young endlinehere  the abbot looked up from the holy book and cried out in anger hold your tongue endlinehere  how dare you obstruct the kings highroad you saucy varlet get out of my way endlinehere  then he gave the fool a cut with his whip and leaving him smarting he rode away endlinehere  the fool was angry the fool was sore and he cursed the folly of monks and maids endlinehere  if i could but meet with a man sighed the fool for a woman fears and a friar upbraids endlinehere  then he saw a flashing of distant steel and the clanking of harness greeted his ears and up the road journeyed knights at arms with waving plumes and glittering spears endlinehere  the fool took notice and slowly arose not quite so sure was his foolish heart endlinehere  if priests and women would none of him was it likely a knight would take his part endlinehere  they sang as they rode these lusty boys when one chanced to turn toward the highways side theres a sorry figure of fun jested he well sirrah endlinehere  move back there is scarce room to ride endlinehere  then the company halted and laughed out loud endlinehere  was such a request ever made to a knight endlinehere  and where are your legs asked one if you start you may be inside the town gates to night endlinehere  t is a lazy fellow let him alone theyve no room in the town for such idlers as he endlinehere  but one bent from his saddle and said my man art thou not ashamed to beg charity endlinehere  thou art well set up and thy legs are strong but it much misgives me lest thourt a fool for beggars get only a beggars crust wise men are reared in a different school endlinehere  purple tree shadows crept over the road the level sun flung an orange light and the fool laid his head on the hard gray stone and wept as he realized advancing night endlinehere  a great round moon rose over a hill and the steady wind blew yet more cool and crouched on a stone a wayfarer sobbed for at last he knew he was only a fool endlinehere  the stars hang thick in the apple tree the south wind smells of the pungent sea gold tulip cups are heavy with dew endlinehere  the nights for you sweetheart for you endlinehere  starfire rains from the vaulted blue endlinehere  the dancing of unseen leaves endlinehere  a drowsy swallow stirs in the eaves endlinehere  only a maiden is sorrowing endlinehere  t is night and spring sweetheart and spring endlinehere  starfire lights your hearts blossoming endlinehere  in the intimate dark theres never an ear though the tulips stand on tiptoe to hear so give ripe fruit must shrivel or fall endlinehere  as you are mine sweetheart give all endlinehere  starfire sparkles your coronal endlinehere  what is poetry endlinehere  is it a mosaic of coloured stones which curiously are wrought into a pattern endlinehere  softly the water ripples against the canoes curving side softly the birch trees rustle flinging over us branches wide endlinehere  from the shore come the scents of a garden and between a gap in the trees a proud white statue glimmers in cold disdainful ease endlinehere  the child of a southern people the thought of an alien race what does she in this pale northern garden how reconcile it with her grace endlinehere  but the moon in her wayward beauty is ever and always the same as lovely as when upon latmos she watched till endymion came endlinehere  through the water the moon writes her legends in light on the smooth wet sand they endure for a moment and vanish and no one may understand endlinehere  all round us the secret of nature is telling itself to our sight we may guess at her meaning but never can know the full mystery of night endlinehere  but her power of enchantment is on us we bow to the spell which she weaves made up of the murmur of waves and the manifold whisper of leaves endlinehere  to me it is not so endlinehere  to me alone it is a time of pause a void and silent space between two worlds when inspiration lags and feeling sleeps gathering strength for efforts yet to come endlinehere  for life alone is creator of life and closest contact with the human world is like a lantern shining in the night to light me to a knowledge of myself endlinehere  as for a moment he stands in hardy masculine beauty poised on the fircrested rock over the pool which below him gleams in the wavering sunlight waiting the shock of his plunging endlinehere  so for a moment i stand my feet planted firm in the present eagerly scanning the future which is so soon to possess me endlinehere  later the solitude vanished confused and distracted the road where many were seeking and jostling endlinehere  left behind were the trees and the flowers the half realized beauty of quiet the sacred unconscious communing endlinehere  and now he is come to a river a line of gray sullen water not blue and splashing but dark rolling somberly on to the ocean endlinehere  but on the far side is a city whose windows flame gold in the sunset endlinehere  be strong to uphold him and bear him across to the city the beautiful city whose spires still glow with the fires of sunset endlinehere  look dear how bright the moonlight is to night endlinehere  see where it casts the shadow of that tree far out upon the grass endlinehere  it seems as though the garden which you love were like a swinging censer its incense floating before us as a reverent act to sanctify and bless our night of love endlinehere  i need to hear it often for my heart doubts naturally and finds it hard to trust endlinehere  ah dearest you are good to love me so and yet i would not have it goodness rather excess of selfishness in you to need me through and through as flowers need the sun endlinehere  has your life too been waiting for this time not only mine the sharpness of this joy endlinehere  dear heart i love you worship you as though i were a priest before a holy shrine endlinehere  im glad that you are beautiful although were you not lovely still i needs must love but you are all things it must have been so for otherwise it were not you endlinehere  come close when you are in the circle of my arm faith grows a mountain and i take my stand upon its utmost top endlinehere  yes yes once more kiss me and let me feel you very near wanting me wholly even as i want you endlinehere  have years behind been dark endlinehere  will those to come bring unguessed sorrows into our two lives endlinehere  what does it matter we have had to night endlinehere  to night will make us strong for we believe each in the other this is a sacrament endlinehere  i know a country laced with roads they join the hills and they span the brooks they weave like a shuttle between broad fields and slide discreetly through hidden nooks endlinehere  they are canopied like a persian dome and carpeted with orient dyes endlinehere  they are myriad voiced and musical and scented with happiest memories endlinehere  o winding roads that i know so well every twist and turn every hollow and hill endlinehere  they are set in my heart to a pulsing tune gay as a honey bee humming in june endlinehere  o uphill roads and roads that dip down endlinehere  you curl your sun spattered length along and your march is beaten into a song by the softly ringing hoofs of a horse and the panting breath of the dogs i love endlinehere  the pageant of autumn follows its course and the blue sky of autumn laughs above endlinehere  and the song and the country become as one i see it as music i hear it as light prismatic and shimmering trembling to tone the land of desire my souls delight endlinehere  and always it beats in my listening ears with the gentle thud of a horses stride with the swift falling steps of many dogs following following at my side endlinehere  o roads that journey to fairyland endlinehere  how still it is endlinehere  what sound is that which echoes through the wood endlinehere  is it the reedy note of an oaten pipe endlinehere  perchance a minute more will see the brood of the shaggy forest god and on his lip will rest the rushes he is wont to play endlinehere  his train in woven baskets bear ripe fruit and weave a dance with ropes of gray acorns so light their touch the grasses scarcely sway as they the measure tread to the lilting flute endlinehere  t is only fancy thus adorns endlinehere  a cloud drifts idly over the shining sun endlinehere  how damp it seems how silent still and strange endlinehere  surely t was here some tragedy was done and here the chorus sang each coming change endlinehere  the tread of sandalled feet comes noiselessly endlinehere  the silence almost is a sound and dreams take on the semblances of finite things so potent is the spell that what but seems elsewhere is lifted here on fancys wings endlinehere  the little woodland theatre seems to wait all tremulous with hope and wistful joy for something that is sure to come at last some deep emotion satisfying great endlinehere  it grows a living presence bold and shy cradling the future in a glorious past endlinehere  the octagon tower casts a shade cool and gray like a cutlass blade in sun baked vines the cicalas spin the little green lizards run out and in endlinehere  a sail dips over the oceans rim and bubbles rise to the fountains brim endlinehere  slowly she walks to the balustrade idly notes how the blossoms fade in the suns caress then crosses where the shadow shelters a carven chair endlinehere  within its curve supine she lies and wearily closes her tired eyes endlinehere  the minstrel beseeches his silver strings and holding the lady spellbound sings down the road to avignon the long long road to avignon across the bridge to avignon one morning in the spring endlinehere  clouds sail over the distant trees petals are shaken down by the breeze they fall on the terrace tiles like snow the sighing of waves sounds far below endlinehere  a humming bird kisses the lips of a rose then laden with honey and love he goes endlinehere  step by step and he comes to her fearful lest she suddenly stir endlinehere  sunshine and silence and each to each the lute and his singing their only speech he leans above her her eyes unclose the humming bird enters another rose endlinehere  the minstrel hushes his silver strings endlinehere  the beating of humming birds wings endlinehere  down the road to avignon the long long road to avignon across the bridge to avignon one morning in the spring endlinehere  i hear the sigh the goaded city gives not day nor night can ease her heart her anguished labours stay endlinehere  below straight streets monotonous from north and south from east and west stretch glittering and luminous above one tower tops the rest and holds aloft mans constant quest time endlinehere  joyless emblem of the greed of millions robber of the best which earth can give the vulgar creed has seared upon the night its flaming ruthless screed endlinehere  whose soothing presence brings the quiet shining of the stars endlinehere  whose cloak of darkness clings so intimately close that scars are hid from our own eyes endlinehere  beggars by day our wealth is having night to burn our souls before altars dim and tree shadowed where the light is shed from a young moon mysteriously bright endlinehere  where art thou hiding where thy peace endlinehere  this is the hour but thou art not endlinehere  will waking tumult never cease endlinehere  hast thou thy votary forgot endlinehere  nature forsakes this man begot and festering wilderness and now the long still hours are here no jot of dear communing do i know instead the glaring man filled city groans below endlinehere  on winter nights beside the nursery fire we read the fairy tale while glowing coals builded its pictures endlinehere  the foliage seemed to rustle in the wind a silent murmur carved in still gray stone endlinehere  a sudden blare of trumpets and the throng about the entrance parted as the guests filed singly in with rare and precious gifts endlinehere  our eager fancies noted all they brought the glorious unattainable delights endlinehere  but always there was one unbidden guest who cursed the child and left it bitterness endlinehere  the fire falls asunder all is changed i am no more a child and what i see is not a fairy tale but life my life endlinehere  the gifts are there the many pleasant things health wealth long settled friendships with a name which honors all who bear it and the power of making words obedient endlinehere  this is much but overshadowing all is still the curse that never shall i be fulfilled by love endlinehere  along the parching highroad of the world no other soul shall bear mine company endlinehere  so i behold my visions on the ground no longer radiant an ignoble heap of broken dusty glass endlinehere  and so unlit even by hope or faith my dragging steps force me forever through the passing days endlinehere  you came to me bearing bright roses red like the wine of your heart you twisted them into a garland to set me aside from the mart endlinehere  red roses to crown me your lover and i walked aureoled and apart endlinehere  enslaved and encircled i bore it proud token of my gift to you endlinehere  the petals waned paler and shriveled and dropped and the thorns started through endlinehere  bitter thorns to proclaim me your lover a diadem woven with rue endlinehere  dear bessie would my tired rhyme had force to rise from apathy and shaking off its lethargy ring word tones like a christmas chime endlinehere  but in my souls high belfry chill the bitter wind of doubt has blown the summer swallows all have flown the bells are frost bound mute and still endlinehere  upon the crumbling boards the snow has drifted deep the clappers hang prismed with icicles their clang unheard since ages long ago endlinehere  the rope i pull is stiff and cold my straining ears detect no sound except a sigh as round and round the wind rocks through the timbers old endlinehere  below i know the church is bright with haloed tapers warm with prayer but here i only feel the air of icy centuries of night endlinehere  beneath my feet the snow is lit and gemmed with colours red and blue topaz and green where light falls through the saints that in the windows sit endlinehere  here darkness seems a spectred thing voiceless and haunting while the stars mock with a light of long dead years the ache of present suffering endlinehere  silent and winter killed i stand no carol hymns my debt to you but take this frozen thought in lieu and thaw its music in your hand endlinehere  thou father of the children of my brain by thee engendered in my willing heart how can i thank thee for this gift of art poured out so lavishly and not in vain endlinehere  what thou created never more can die thy fructifying power lives in me and i conceive knowing it is by thee dear other parent of my poetry endlinehere  all unknown by me unguessed by thee not even dreamed a tree has blossomed in a night that seemed of stubborn barren wood endlinehere  for thou hast sown this seed of beauty in a ground of truth endlinehere  humbly i dedicate myself and yet i tremble with a sudden fear to set new music ringing through my fading youth endlinehere  his eyelids burnt and quivered with the strain of looking and against his temples beat the all enshrouding suffocating dark endlinehere  he stumbled lurched and struck against a door that opened and a howl of obscene mirth grated his senses wallowing on the floor lay men and dogs and women in the dirt endlinehere  he sickened loathing it and as he gazed the candle guttered flared and then went out endlinehere  then as he leaned unconscious where the great oak door blew back and cast him bruised and dripping in the church endlinehere  his eyes from long sojourning in the night were blinded now as by some glorious sun he slowly crawled toward the altar steps endlinehere  he could not think for heavy in his ears an organ boomed majestic harmonies he only knew that what he saw was light endlinehere  he bowed himself before a cross of flame and shut his eyes in fear lest it should fade endlinehere  blue through the window burns the twilight heavy through trees blows the warm south wind endlinehere  glistening against the chill gray sky light wet black branches are barred and entwined endlinehere  sodden and spongy the scarce green grass plot dents into pools where a foot has been endlinehere  puddles lie spilt in the road a mass not of water but steel with its cold hard sheen endlinehere  faint fades the fire on the hearth its embers scattering wide at a stronger gust endlinehere  above the old weathercock groans but remembers creaking to turn in its centuried rust endlinehere  dying forlorn in dreary sorrow wrapping the mists round her withering form day sinks down and in darkness to morrow travails to birth in the womb of the storm endlinehere  deeps of unhewn woods alone can cherish thee alone possess thy quiet teeming vigor endlinehere  this our crime not to have worshipped marred by alien moods that sole condition of all loveliness the dreaming lapse of slow unmeasured time endlinehere  dawn fills the room and penetrating bright the silent sunbeams through the window pour endlinehere  and she lies sleeping ignorant of fate enmeshed in listless dreams her soul not yet ripened to bear the purport of this day endlinehere  the morning breeze scarce stirs the coverlet a shadow falls across the sunlight wait endlinehere  a lark is singing as he flies away endlinehere  beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun scorching against the blue flame of the sky endlinehere  brown lily pads lie heavy and supine within a granite basin under one the bronze gold glimmer of a carp and i reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine endlinehere  another year is quick with import endlinehere  such each year has been endlinehere  unmoved thou watchest all and all bequeath some jewel to thy diadem of power thou pledge of greater majesty unseen endlinehere  a little garden on a bleak hillside where deep the heavy dazzling mountain snow lies far into the spring endlinehere  the suns pale glow is scarcely able to melt patches wide about the single rose bush endlinehere  all denied of natures tender ministries endlinehere  but no for wonder working faith has made it blow with flowers many hued and starry eyed endlinehere  a little garden loved with a great love endlinehere  thou yellow trumpeter of laggard spring endlinehere  thou herald of rich summers myriad flowers endlinehere  always bold to stand erect full in the dazzling play of aprils sun for thou hast caught his gold endlinehere  t is you that are the music not your song endlinehere  the song is but a door which opening wide lets forth the pent up melody inside your spirits harmony which clear and strong sings but of you endlinehere  throughout your whole life long your songs your thoughts your doings each divide this perfect beauty waves within a tide or single notes amid a glorious throng endlinehere  the song of earth has many different chords ocean has many moods and many tones yet always ocean endlinehere  in the damp spring woods the painted trillium smiles while crisp pine cones autumn alone can ripen endlinehere  so is this one music with a thousand cadences endlinehere  so still it stands surely our own if we exert our might endlinehere  never canst thou grasp this fleeting gleam its glowing flame would die if it were caught its value is that it doth always seem but just a little farther on endlinehere  distraught but lighted ever onward we are brought upon our way unknowing in a dream endlinehere  brave idolatry which can conceive a hero endlinehere  no deceit no knowledge taught by unrelenting years can quench this fierce untamable desire endlinehere  we know that what we long for once achieved will cease to satisfy endlinehere  be still our fears if what we worship fail us still the fire burns on and it is much to have believed endlinehere  must all of worth be travailled for and those lifes brightest stars rise from a troubled sea endlinehere  must years go by in sad uncertainty leaving us doubting whose the conquering blows are we or fate the victors endlinehere  time which shows all inner meanings will reveal but we shall never know the upshot endlinehere  sudden we lack the flash of insight life grows drear and gray and hour follows hour nerveless slack endlinehere  austere arbiter of each mans fate by whom he learns that natures steadfast laws are as decrees immutable o pause your even forward march endlinehere  not yet too late teach me the needed lesson when to wait inactive as a ship when no wind draws to stretch the loosened cordage endlinehere  what instinct forces man to journey on urged by a longing blind but dominant endlinehere  nothing he sees can hold him nothing daunt his never failing eagerness endlinehere  the sun setting in splendour every night has won his vassalage those towers flamboyant of airy cloudland palaces now haunt his daylight wanderings endlinehere  the wind is singing through the trees to night a deep voiced song of rushing cadences and crashing intervals endlinehere  above the tossing trees shines down a star quietly bright this wild tumultuous joy quickens nor dims its splendour endlinehere  and my mind o star endlinehere  is filled with your white light from far so suffer me this one night to enjoy the freedom of the onward sweeping wind endlinehere  the path runs straight between the flowering rows a moonlit path hemmed in by beds of bloom where phlox and marigolds dispute for room with tall red dahlias and the briar rose endlinehere  t is reckless prodigality which throws into the night these wafts of rich perfume which sweep across the garden like a plume endlinehere  over the trees a single bright star glows endlinehere  how is it that being gone you fill my days and all the long nights are made glad by thee endlinehere  no loneliness is this nor misery but great content that these should be the ways whereby the fancy dreaming as she strays makes bright and present what she would would be endlinehere  and who shall say if the reality is not with dreams so pregnant endlinehere  it may be vain illusion endlinehere  alas how few there are who strike in us a chord we knew existed but so seldom heard its tone we tremble at the half forgotten sound endlinehere  the world is full of rude awakenings and heaven born castles shattered to the ground yet still our human longing vainly clings to a belief in beauty through all wrongs endlinehere  o stay your hand and leave my heart its songs endlinehere  what torture lurks within a single thought when grown too constant and however kind however welcome still the weary mind aches with its presence endlinehere  dull remembrance taught remembers on unceasingly unsought the old delight is with us but to find that all recurring joy is pain refined become a habit and we struggle caught endlinehere  you lie upon my heart as on a nest folded in peace for you can never know how crushed i am with having you at rest heavy upon my life endlinehere  i love you so you bind my freedom from its rightful quest endlinehere  in mercy lift your drooping wings and go endlinehere  i do not care to talk to you although your speech evokes a thousand sympathies and all my beings silent harmonies wake trembling into music endlinehere  when you go it is as if some sudden dreadful blow had severed all the strings with savage ease endlinehere  no do not talk but let us rather seize this intimate gift of silence which we know endlinehere  others may guess your thoughts from what you say as storms are guessed from clouds where darkness broods endlinehere  to me the very essence of the day reveals its inner purpose and its moods as poplars feel the rain and then straightway reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods endlinehere  now you are come endlinehere  you tremble like a star poised where behind earths rim the sun has set endlinehere  your voice has sung across my heart but numb and mute i have no tones to answer endlinehere  far within i kneel before you speechless yet and life ablaze with beauty i am dumb endlinehere  how empty seems the town now you are gone endlinehere  a wilderness of sad streets where gaunt walls hide nothing to desire sunshine falls eery distorted as it long had shone on white dead faces tombed in halls of stone endlinehere  the whir of motors stricken through with calls of playing boys floats up at intervals but all these noises blur to one long moan endlinehere  what quest is worth pursuing endlinehere  and how strange that other men still go accustomed ways endlinehere  i hate their interest in the things they do endlinehere  a spectre horde repeating without change an old routine endlinehere  alone i know the days are still born and the world stopped lacking you endlinehere  all night i wrestled with a memory which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought endlinehere  the crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought its disillusion now i only cry for peace for power to forget the lie which hope too long has whispered endlinehere  so i sought the sleep which would not come and night was fraught with old emotions weeping silently endlinehere  i heard your voice again and knew the things which you had promised proved an empty vaunt endlinehere  i felt your clinging hands while nights broad wings cherished our love in darkness endlinehere  from the lawn a sudden quivering birdnote like a taunt endlinehere  my arms held nothing but the empty dawn endlinehere  to make a pavement for your feet i stripped my soul for you to walk upon and slipped beneath your steps to soften all your ways endlinehere  but now my letters are like blossoms pale we strew upon a grave with hopeless tears endlinehere  i ask no recompense i shall not fail although you do not heed the long sad years still pass and still i scatter flowers frail and whisper words of love which no one hears endlinehere  throughout the echoing chambers of my brain i hear your words in mournful cadence toll like some slow passing bell which warns the soul of sundering darkness endlinehere  unrelenting fain to batter down resistance fall again stroke after stroke insistent diastole the bitter blows of truth until the whole is hammered into fact made strangely plain endlinehere  where shall i look for comfort endlinehere  our worlds are drawn apart our spirits suns divided and the light of mine burnt dim endlinehere  now in the haunted twilight i must do your will endlinehere  i grasp the cup which over runs and with my trembling lips i touch the rim endlinehere  i cant get out said the starling endlinehere  sternes sentimental journey endlinehere  forever the impenetrable wall of self confines my poor rebellious soul i never see the towering white clouds roll before a sturdy wind save through the small barred window of my jail endlinehere  i live a thrall with all my outer life a clipped square hole rectangular a fraction of a scroll unwound and winding like a worsted ball endlinehere  my thoughts are grown uneager and depressed through being always mine my fancys wings are moulted and the feathers blown away endlinehere  i weary for desires never guessed for alien passions strange imaginings to be some other person for a day endlinehere  white glittering sunlight fills the market square spotted and sprigged with shadows endlinehere  the market glows and flaunts and clatters in its busy care endlinehere  the law of duty urged that he should roam should sail from fog and chilly airs to skies clear with deceitful welcome endlinehere  he had come with proud resolve but still his lonely eyes ached with fatigue at never seeing home endlinehere  smoulderings of sacrificial fires burst their rings and blotted out in smoke his lost domain endlinehere  bereft of courtiers only with his queen from empty palace down to empty quay endlinehere  no challenge screamed from hostile carabine endlinehere  boyish sympathetic man endlinehere  crumbled before thy majesty we bow endlinehere  the little gallery winds round about the middle of a most secluded room midway between the ceiling and the floor endlinehere  for books are more than books they are the life the very heart and core of ages past the reason why men lived and worked and died the essence and quintessence of their lives endlinehere  silently waiting that from time to time it may be given them to illuminate dull daily facts with pristine radiance for some long waited for affinity who lingers yet in the deep womb of time endlinehere  the shifting sun pierces the young green leaves of elm trees newly coming into bud and splashes on the floor and on the books through old high rounded windows dim with age endlinehere  the noisy city sounds of modern life float softened to us across the old graveyard endlinehere  the room is filled with a warm mellow light no garish colours jar on our content the books upon the shelves are old and worn endlinehere  t was no belated effort nor attempt to keep abreast with old as well as new that placed them here tricked in a modern guise easily got and held in light esteem endlinehere  a nothing truly yet a link that binds all ages to their own inheritance and stretching backward dim and dimmer still is lost in a remote antiquity endlinehere  grapes do not come of thorns nor figs of thistles and even a great poets divinest thought is coloured by the world he knows and sees endlinehere  nay the little things of daily life it is which mold and shape and make him apt for noble deeds and true endlinehere  the long still fruitful hours slip away shedding their influences as they pass we know ourselves the richer to have sat upon this dusty floor and dreamed our dreams endlinehere  no other place to us were quite the same no other dreams so potent in their charm for this is ours endlinehere  the building simply bodies forth a thought peculiarly inherent to the race endlinehere  and we descendants of that elder time have learnt to love the very form in which the thought has been embodied to our years endlinehere  it takes some time for moss and vines to grow and warmly cover gaunt and chill stone walls of stately buildings from the cold north wind endlinehere  the lichen of affection takes as long or longer ere it lovingly enfolds a place which since without it were bereft all stript and bare shorn of its chiefest grace endlinehere  sea shell sea shell sing me a song o please endlinehere  sea shell sea shell sing of the things you know so well endlinehere  near where i live there is a lake as blue as blue can be winds make it dance as they go blowing by endlinehere  i think it curtseys to the sky endlinehere  its just a lake of lovely flowers and my mamma says they are ours but they are not like those we grow to be our very own you know endlinehere  we have a splendid garden there are lots of flowers everywhere roses and pinks and four oclocks and hollyhocks and evening stocks endlinehere  mamma lets us pick them but never must we pick any gentians ever endlinehere  for if we carried them away theyd die of homesickness that day endlinehere  my grandpapa lives in a wonderful house with a great many windows and doors there are stairs that go up and stairs that go down and such beautiful slippery floors endlinehere  but of all of the rooms even mothers and mine and the bookroom and parlour and all i like the green dining room so much the best because of its ceiling and wall endlinehere  right over your head is a funny round hole with apples and pears falling through theres a big bunch of grapes all purply and sweet and melons and pineapples too endlinehere  they tumble and tumble but never come down though ive stood underneath a long while with my mouth open wide for i always have hoped just a cherry would drop from the pile endlinehere  no matter how early i run there to look it has always begun to fall through and one night when at bedtime i crept in to see it was falling by candle light too endlinehere  i am sure they are magical fruits and each one makes you hear things or see things or go forever invisible but its no use and of course i shall just never know endlinehere  for the ladders too heavy to lift and the chairs are not nearly so tall as i need endlinehere  ive given up hope and i feel i shall die without having accomplished the deed endlinehere  its a little bit sad when you seem very near to adventures and things of that sort which nearly begin and then dont and you know it is only because you are short endlinehere  slipping softly through the sky little horned happy moon can you hear me up so high endlinehere  will you come down soon endlinehere  on my nursery window sill will you stay your steady flight endlinehere  and then float away with me through the summer night endlinehere  brushing over tops of trees playing hide and seek with stars peeping up through shiny clouds at jupiter or mars endlinehere  i shall fill my lap with roses gathered in the milky way all to carry home to mother endlinehere  what will she say endlinehere  little rocking sailing moon do you hear me shout ahoy endlinehere  just a little nearer moon to please a little boy endlinehere  high up in the apple tree climbing i go with the sky above me the earth below endlinehere  each branch is the step of a wonderful stair which leads to the town i see shining up there endlinehere  climbing climbing higher and higher the branches blow and i see a spire the gleam of a turret the glint of a dome all sparkling and bright like white sea foam endlinehere  on and on from bough to bough the leaves are thick but i push my way through before i have always had to stop but to day i am sure i shall reach the top endlinehere  today to the end of the marvelous stair where those glittering pinacles flash in the air endlinehere  climbing climbing higher i go with the sky close above me the earth far below endlinehere  naughty little speckled trout cant i coax you to come out endlinehere  is it such great fun to play in the water every day endlinehere  do you pull the naiads hair hiding in the lilies there endlinehere  do you hunt for fishes eggs or watch tadpoles grow their legs endlinehere  do the little trouts have school in some deep sun glinted pool and in recess play at tag round that bed of purple flag endlinehere  i have tried so hard to catch you hours and hours ive sat to watch you but you never will come out naughty little speckled trout endlinehere  he shouts in the sails of the ships at sea he steals the down from the honeybee he makes the forest trees rustle and sing he twirls my kite till it breaks its string endlinehere  laughing dancing sunny wind whistling howling rainy wind north south east and west each is the wind i like the best endlinehere  he calls up the fog and hides the hills he whirls the wings of the great windmills the weathercocks love him and turn to discover his whereabouts but hes gone the rover endlinehere  the pine trees toss him their cones with glee the flowers bend low in courtesy each wave flings up a shower of pearls the flag in front of the school unfurls endlinehere  by day you cannot see the sky for it is up so very high endlinehere  you look and look but its so blue that you can never see right through endlinehere  but when night comes it is quite plain and all the stars are there again endlinehere  they seem just like old friends to me ive known them all my life you see endlinehere  there is the dipper first and there is cassiopeia in her chair orions belt the milky way and lots i know but cannot say endlinehere  one group looks like a swarm of bees papa says theyre the pleiades but i think they must be the toy of some nice little angel boy endlinehere  perhaps his jackstones which to day he has forgot to put away and left them lying on the sky where he will find them bye and bye endlinehere  i wish hed come and play with me endlinehere  wed have such fun for it would be a most unusual thing for boys to feel that they had stars for toys endlinehere  we grasp our battle spears we don our breast plates of hide endlinehere  the axles of our chariots touch our short swords meet endlinehere  standards obscure the sun the foe roll up like clouds endlinehere  arrows fall thick the warriors press forward endlinehere  they menace our ranks they break our line endlinehere  the left hand trace horse is dead the one on the right is smitten endlinehere  the fallen horses block our wheels they impede the yoke horses endlinehere  they grasp their jade drum sticks they beat the sounding drums endlinehere  heaven decrees their fall the dread powers are angry endlinehere  the warriors are all dead they lie on the moor field endlinehere  they issued but shall not enter they went but shall not return endlinehere  the plains are flat and wide the way home is long endlinehere  their swords lie beside them their black bows in their hand endlinehere  though their limbs were torn their hearts could not be repressed endlinehere  they were more than brave they were inspired with the spirit of wu endlinehere  steadfast to the end they could not be daunted endlinehere  their bodies were stricken but their souls have taken immortality captains among the ghosts heroes among the dead endlinehere  to be an orphan to be fated to be an orphan endlinehere  how bitter is this lot endlinehere  when my father and mother were alive i used to ride in a carriage with four fine horses endlinehere  but when they both died my brother and sister in law sent me out to be a merchant endlinehere  in the south i travelled to the nine rivers and in the east as far as chi and lu endlinehere  my brother told me to get ready the dinner endlinehere  my sister in law told me to see after the horses endlinehere  i was always going up into the hall and running down again to the parlour endlinehere  my tears fell like rain endlinehere  in the morning they sent me to draw water i didnt get back till night fall endlinehere  my hands were all sore and i had no shoes endlinehere  i walked the cold earth treading on thorns and brambles endlinehere  as i stopped to pull out the thorns how bitter my heart was endlinehere  my tears fell and fell and i went on sobbing and sobbing endlinehere  in winter i have no great coat nor in summer thin clothes endlinehere  it is no pleasure to be alive endlinehere  i had rather quickly leave the earth and go beneath the yellow springs endlinehere  the april winds blow and the grass is growing green endlinehere  in the third month silkworms and mulberries in the sixth month the melon harvest endlinehere  i went out with the melon cart and just as i was coming home the melon cart turned over endlinehere  the people who came to help me were few but the people who ate the melons were many all they left me was the stalks to take home as fast as i could endlinehere  my brother and sister in law were harsh they asked me all sorts of awful questions endlinehere  why does everyone in the village hate me endlinehere  i want to write a letter and send it to my mother and father under the earth and tell them i cant go on any longer living with my brother and sister in law endlinehere  she had been ill for years and years she sent for me to say something endlinehere  she couldnt say what she wanted because of the tears that kept coming of themselves endlinehere  i have burdened you with orphan children with orphan children two or three endlinehere  dont let our children go hungry or cold if they do wrong dont slap or beat them endlinehere  when you take out the baby rock it in your arms endlinehere  last she said when i carried them in my arms they had no clothes and now their jackets have no linings endlinehere  _ i shut the doors and barred the windows and left the motherless children endlinehere  when i got to the market and met my friends i wept endlinehere  i sat down and could not go with them endlinehere  i asked them to buy some cakes for my children endlinehere  in the presence of my friends i sobbed and cried endlinehere  i tried not to grieve but sorrow would not cease endlinehere  i felt in my pocket and gave my friends some money endlinehere  when i got home i found my children calling to be taken into their mothers arms endlinehere  i walked up and down in the empty room this way and that a long while endlinehere  then i went away from it and said to myself i will forget and never speak of her again endlinehere  in the eastern quarter dawn breaks the stars flicker pale endlinehere  the morning cock at ju nan mounts the wall and crows endlinehere  the songs are over the clock run down but still the feast is set endlinehere  the moon grows dim and the stars are few morning has come to the world endlinehere  at a thousand gates and ten thousand doors the fish shaped keys turn round the palace and up by the castle the crows and magpies are flying endlinehere  we go to the golden palace we set out the jade cups endlinehere  we summon the honoured guests to enter at the golden gate endlinehere  they enter at the golden gate and go to the golden hall endlinehere  in the eastern kitchen the meat is sliced and ready roast beef and boiled pork and mutton endlinehere  the master of the feast hands round the wine endlinehere  the harp players sound their clear chords endlinehere  the cups are pushed aside and we face each other at chess the rival pawns are marshalled rank against rank endlinehere  the fire glows and the smoke puffs and curls from the incense burner rises a delicate fragrance endlinehere  the clear wine has made our cheeks red round the table joy and peace prevail endlinehere  may those who shared in this days delight through countless autumns enjoy like felicity endlinehere  at fifteen i went with the army at fourscore i came home endlinehere  on the way i met a man from the village i asked him who there was at home endlinehere  that over there is your house all covered over with trees and bushes endlinehere  rabbits had run in at the dog hole pheasants flew down from the beams of the roof endlinehere  in the courtyard was growing some wild grain and by the well some wild mallows endlinehere  ill boil the grain and make porridge ill pluck the mallows and make soup endlinehere  soup and porridge are both cooked but there is no one to eat them with endlinehere  i went out and looked towards the east while tears fell and wetted my clothes endlinehere  in a narrow road where there was not room to pass my carriage met the carriage of a young man endlinehere  and while his axle was touching my axle in the narrow road i asked him where he lived endlinehere  the place where i live is easy enough to find easy to find and difficult to forget endlinehere  in the midst of the courtyard grows a cassia tree and candles on its branches flaring away in the night endlinehere  they fought south of the castle they died north of the wall endlinehere  they died in the moors and were not buried endlinehere  their flesh was the food of crows endlinehere  tell the crows we are not afraid we have died in the moors and cannot be buried endlinehere  crows how can our bodies escape you endlinehere  the waters flowed deep and the rushes in the pool were dark endlinehere  the riders fought and were slain their horses wander neighing endlinehere  by the bridge there was a house endlinehere  was it south was it north endlinehere  the harvest was never gathered endlinehere  how can we give you your offerings endlinehere  you served your prince faithfully though all in vain endlinehere  i think of you faithful soldiers your service shall not be forgotten endlinehere  for in the morning you went out to battle and at night you did not return endlinehere  i went out at the eastern gate i never thought to return endlinehere  but i came back to the gate with my heart full of sorrow endlinehere  there was not a peck of rice in the bin there was not a coat hanging on the pegs endlinehere  so i took my sword and went towards the gate endlinehere  my wife and child clutched at my coat and wept some people want to be rich and grand i only want to share my porridge with you endlinehere  above we have the blue waves of the sky below the yellow face of this little child endlinehere  dear wife i cannot stay endlinehere  soon it will be too late endlinehere  when one is growing old one cannot put things off endlinehere  she went up the mountain to pluck wild herbs she came down the mountain and met her former husband endlinehere  she knelt down and asked her former husband what do you find your new wife like endlinehere  my new wife although her talk is clever cannot charm me as my old wife could endlinehere  in beauty of face there is not much to choose endlinehere  but in usefulness they are not at all alike endlinehere  my new wife comes in from the road to meet me my old wife always came down from her tower endlinehere  my new wife is clever at embroidering silk my old wife was good at plain sewing endlinehere  of silk embroidery one can do an inch a day of plain sewing more than five feet endlinehere  putting her silks by the side of your sewing i see that the new will not compare with the old endlinehere  my love is living to the south of the great sea endlinehere  what shall i send to greet him endlinehere  two pearls and a comb of tortoise shell ill send them to him packed in a box of jade endlinehere  they tell me he is not true they tell me he dashed my box to the ground dashed it to the ground and burnt it and scattered its ashes to the wind endlinehere  from this day to the ends of time i must never think of him never again think of him endlinehere  the cocks are crowing and the dogs are barking my brother and his wife will soon know endlinehere  the autumn wind is blowing the morning wind is sighing endlinehere  in a moment the sun will rise in the east and then _it_ too will know endlinehere  i am a prisoner in the hands of the enemy enduring the shame of captivity endlinehere  my bones stick out and my strength is gone through not getting enough to eat endlinehere  my brother is a mandarin and his horses are fed on maize endlinehere  why cant he spare a little money to send and ransom me endlinehere  if you were riding in a coach and i were wearing a li and one day we met in the road you would get down and bow endlinehere  if you were carrying a tng and i were riding on a horse and one day we met in the road i would get down for you endlinehere  i want to be your friend for ever and ever without break or decay endlinehere  how swiftly it dries the dew on the garlic leaf the dew that dries so fast to morrow will fall again endlinehere  but he whom we carry to the grave will never more return endlinehere  what mans land is the graveyard endlinehere  it is the crowded home of ghosts wise and foolish shoulder to shoulder endlinehere  the king of the dead claims them all mans fate knows no tarrying endlinehere  on and on always on and on away from you parted by a life parting endlinehere  going from one another ten thousand li each in a different corner of the world endlinehere  the way between is difficult and long face to face how shall we meet again endlinehere  since we parted the time is already long daily my clothes hang looser round my waist endlinehere  floating clouds obscure the white sun the wandering one has quite forgotten home endlinehere  thinking of you has made me suddenly old the months and years swiftly draw to their close endlinehere  ill put you out of my mind and forget for ever and try with all my might to eat and thrive endlinehere  green green the grass by the river bank endlinehere  thick thick the willow trees in the garden endlinehere  sad sad the lady in the tower endlinehere  white white sitting at the casement window endlinehere  fair fair her red powdered face endlinehere  small small she puts out her pale hand endlinehere  once she was a dancing house girl endlinehere  now she is a wandering mans wife endlinehere  the wandering man went but did not return endlinehere  it is hard alone to keep an empty bed endlinehere  green green the cypress on the mound endlinehere  firm firm the boulder in the stream endlinehere  mans life lived within this world is like the sojourning of a hurried traveller endlinehere  a cup of wine together will make us glad and a little friendship is no little matter endlinehere  yoking my chariot i urge my stubborn horses endlinehere  i wander about in the streets of wan and lo endlinehere  in lo town how fine everything is endlinehere  the caps and belts go seeking each other out endlinehere  the great boulevards are intersected by lanes wherein are the town houses of royal dukes endlinehere  the two palaces stare at each other from afar the twin gates rise a hundred feet endlinehere  by prolonging the feast let us keep our hearts gay and leave no room for sadness to creep in endlinehere  of this days glorious feast and revel the pleasure and delight are difficult to describe endlinehere  plucking the lute they sent forth lingering sounds the new melodies in beauty reached the divine endlinehere  skilful singers intoned the high words those who knew the tune heard the trueness of their singing endlinehere  we sat there each with the same desire and like thoughts by each unexpressed man in the world lodging for a single life time passes suddenly like dust borne on the wind endlinehere  then let us hurry out with high steps and be the first to reach the highways and fords rather than stay at home wretched and poor for long years plunged in sordid grief endlinehere  in the north west there is a high house its top level with the floating clouds endlinehere  embroidered curtains thinly screen its windows its storied tower is built on three steps endlinehere  from above there comes a noise of playing and singing the tune sounding oh endlinehere  who can it be playing so sad a tune endlinehere  surely it must be chi liangs wife endlinehere  the tranquil d follows the winds rising the middle lay lingers indecisive endlinehere  to each note two or three sobs her high will conquered by overwhelming grief endlinehere  she does not regret that she is left so sad but minds that so few can understand her song endlinehere  she wants to become those two wild geese that with beating wings rise high aloft endlinehere  crossing the river i pluck hibiscus flowers in the orchid swamps are many fragrant herbs endlinehere  i gather them but who shall i send them to endlinehere  my love is living in lands far away endlinehere  i turn and look towards my own country the long road stretches on for ever endlinehere  the same heart yet a different dwelling always fretting till we are grown old endlinehere  a bright moon illumines the night prospect the house cricket chirrups on the eastern wall endlinehere  the handle of the pole star points to the beginning of winter endlinehere  the host of stars is scattered over the sky endlinehere  the white dew wets the moor grasses with sudden swiftness the times and seasons change endlinehere  the autumn cicada sings among the trees the swallows alas whither are they gone endlinehere  once i had a same house friend he took flight and rose high away endlinehere  he did not remember how once we went hand in hand but left me like footsteps behind one in the dust endlinehere  in the south is the winnowing fan and the pole star in the north and a herd boy whose ox has never borne the yoke endlinehere  a friend who is not firm as a great rock is of no profit and idly bears the name endlinehere  in the courtyard there grows a strange tree its green leaves ooze with a fragrant moisture endlinehere  holding the branch i cut a flower from the tree meaning to send it away to the person i love endlinehere  its sweet smell fills my sleeves and lap endlinehere  the road is long how shall i get it there endlinehere  such a thing is not fine enough to send but it may remind him of the time that has past since he left endlinehere  far away twinkles the herd boy star brightly shines the lady of the han river endlinehere  slender slender she plies her white fingers endlinehere  click click go the wheels of her spinning loom endlinehere  at the end of the day she has not finished her task her bitter tears fall like streaming rain endlinehere  the han river runs shallow and clear set between them how short a space endlinehere  but the river water will not let them pass gazing at each other but never able to speak endlinehere  turning my chariot i yoke my horses and go endlinehere  on and on down the long roads the autumn winds shake the hundred grasses endlinehere  on every side how desolate and bare endlinehere  the things i meet are all new things their strangeness hastens the coming of old age endlinehere  prosperity and decay each have their season endlinehere  success is bitter when it is slow in coming endlinehere  mans life is not metal or stone he cannot far prolong the days of his fate endlinehere  suddenly he follows in the way of things that change endlinehere  fame is the only treasure that endures endlinehere  the eastern castle stands tall and high far and wide stretch the towers that guard it endlinehere  the whirling wind uprises and shakes the earth the autumn grasses grow thick and green endlinehere  the four seasons alternate without pause the years end hurries swiftly on endlinehere  the bird of the morning wind is stricken with sorrow the frail cicada suffers and is hard pressed endlinehere  free and clear let us loosen the bonds of our hearts endlinehere  why should we go on always restraining and binding endlinehere  in yen and chao are many fair ladies beautiful people with faces like jade endlinehere  their clothes are made all of silk gauze endlinehere  they stand at the door practising tranquil lays endlinehere  the echo of their singing how sad it sounds endlinehere  by the pitch of the song one knows the stops have been tightened endlinehere  to ease their minds they arrange their shawls and belts lowering their song a little while they pause endlinehere  i should like to be those two flying swallows who are carrying clay to nest in the eaves of your house endlinehere  i drive my chariot up to the eastern gate from afar i see the graveyard north of the wall endlinehere  the white aspens how they murmur murmur pines and cypresses flank the broad paths endlinehere  beneath lie men who died long ago black black is the long night that holds them endlinehere  deep down beneath the yellow springs thousands of years they lie without waking endlinehere  in infinite succession light and darkness shift and years vanish like the morning dew endlinehere  mans life is like a sojourning his longevity lacks the firmness of stone and metal endlinehere  for ever it has been that mourners in their turn were mourned saint and sage all alike are trapped endlinehere  seeking by food to obtain immortality many have been the dupe of strange drugs endlinehere  better far to drink good wine and clothe our bodies in robes of satin and silk endlinehere  the dead are gone and with them we cannot converse endlinehere  the living are here and ought to have our love endlinehere  leaving the city gate i look ahead and see before me only mounds and tombs endlinehere  the old graves are ploughed up into fields the pines and cypresses are hewn for timber endlinehere  in the white aspens sad winds sing their long murmuring kills my heart with grief endlinehere  i want to go home to ride to my village gate endlinehere  i want to go back but theres no road back endlinehere  the years of a lifetime do not reach a hundred endlinehere  yet they contain a thousand years sorrow endlinehere  when days are short and the dull nights long why not take a lamp and wander forth endlinehere  if you want to be happy you must do it now there is no waiting till an after time endlinehere  the fool whos loath to spend the wealth hes got becomes the laughing stock of after ages endlinehere  it is true that master wang became immortal but how can _we_ hope to share his lot endlinehere  cold cold the year draws to its end the crickets and grasshoppers make a doleful chirping endlinehere  the chill wind increases its violence endlinehere  my wandering love has no coat to cover him endlinehere  he gave his embroidered furs to the lady of lo but from me his bedfellow he is quite estranged endlinehere  sleeping alone in the depth of the long night in a dream i thought i saw the light of his face endlinehere  my dear one thought of our old joys together he came in his chariot and gave me the front reins endlinehere  i wanted so to prolong our play and laughter to hold his hand and go back with him in his coach endlinehere  but when he had come he would not stay long nor stop to go with me to the inner chamber endlinehere  truly without the falcons wings to carry me how can i rival the flying winds swiftness endlinehere  i go and lean at the gate and think of my grief my falling tears wet the double gates endlinehere  at the beginning of winter a cold spirit comes the north wind blows chill chill endlinehere  my sorrows being many i know the length of the nights raising my head i look at the stars in their places endlinehere  on the fifteenth day the bright moon is full on the twentieth day the toad and hare wane endlinehere  i put the letter away in the folds of my dress for three years the writing did not fade endlinehere  how with an undivided heart i loved you i fear that you will never know or guess endlinehere  the bright moon oh how white it shines shines down on the gauze curtains of my bed endlinehere  racked by sorrow i toss and cannot sleep endlinehere  picking up my clothes i wander up and down endlinehere  my absent love says that he is happy but i would rather he said he was coming back endlinehere  out in the courtyard i stand hesitating alone endlinehere  to whom can i tell the sad thoughts i think endlinehere  staring before me i enter my room again falling tears wet my mantle and robe endlinehere  autumn wind rises white clouds fly endlinehere  grass and trees wither geese go south endlinehere  orchids all in bloom chrysanthemums smell sweet endlinehere  i think of my lovely lady i never can forget endlinehere  across the mid stream white waves rise flute and drum keep time to sound of the rowers song amidst revel and feasting sad thoughts come youths years how few endlinehere  the sound of her silk skirt has stopped endlinehere  on the marble pavement dust grows endlinehere  her empty room is cold and still endlinehere  fallen leaves are piled against the doors endlinehere  longing for that lovely lady how can i bring my aching heart to rest endlinehere  is it or isnt it endlinehere  i stand and look endlinehere  the swish swish of a silk skirt endlinehere  how slow she comes endlinehere  our love was pure as the snow on the mountains white as a moon between the clouds theyre telling me your thoughts are double thats why ive come to break it off endlinehere  to day well drink a cup of wine endlinehere  to morrow well part beside the canal walking about beside the canal where its branches divide east and west endlinehere  alas and alas and again alas endlinehere  so must a girl cry when shes married if she find not a man of single heart who will not leave her till her hair is white endlinehere  since our hair was plaited and we became man and wife the love between us was never broken by doubt endlinehere  so let us be merry this night together feasting and playing while the good time lasts endlinehere  i suddenly remember the distance that i must travel i spring from bed and look out to see the time endlinehere  the stars and planets are all grown dim in the sky long long is the road i cannot stay endlinehere  i am going on service away to the battle ground and i do not know when i shall come back endlinehere  i hold your hand with only a deep sigh afterwards tears in the days when we are parted endlinehere  with all your might enjoy the spring flowers but do not forget the time of our love and pride endlinehere  know that if i live i will come back again and if i die we will go on thinking of each other endlinehere  the good time will never come back again in a moment our parting will be over endlinehere  anxiously we halt at the road side hesitating we embrace where the fields begin endlinehere  the clouds above are floating across the sky swiftly swiftly passing or blending together endlinehere  the waves in the wind lose their fixed place and are rolled away each to a corner of heaven endlinehere  from now onwards long must be our parting endlinehere  so let us stop again for a little while endlinehere  i wish i could ride on the wings of the morning wind and go with you right to your journeys end endlinehere  i came ten thousand leagues across sandy deserts in the service of my prince to break the hun tribes endlinehere  my way was blocked and barred my arrows and sword broken endlinehere  my armies had faded away my reputation had gone endlinehere  my old mother is long dead endlinehere  although i want to requite my prince how can i return endlinehere  my people have married me in a far corner of earth sent me away to a strange land to the king of the wu sun endlinehere  a tent is my house of felt are my walls raw flesh my food with mares milk to drink endlinehere  always thinking of my own country my heart sad within endlinehere  would i were a yellow stork and could fly to my old home endlinehere  solemn solemn the coachman gets ready to go chiang chiang the harness bells ring endlinehere  at break of dawn i must start on my long journey at cock crow i must gird on my belt endlinehere  i turn back and look at the empty room for a moment i almost think i see you there endlinehere  one parting but ten thousand regrets as i take my seat my heart is unquiet endlinehere  what shall i do to tell you all my thoughts endlinehere  how can i let you know of all my love endlinehere  precious hairpins make the head to shine and bright mirrors can reflect beauty endlinehere  fragrant herbs banish evil smells and the scholars harp has a clear note endlinehere  the man in the book of odes who was given a quince wanted to pay it back with diamonds and rubies endlinehere  when i think of all the things you have done for me how ashamed i am to have done so little for you endlinehere  although i know that it is a poor return all i can give you is this description of my feelings endlinehere  my poor body is alas unworthy i was ill when first you brought me home endlinehere  limp and weary in the house time passed and i got no better endlinehere  we could hardly ever see each other i could not serve you as i ought endlinehere  then you received the imperial mandate you were ordered to go far away to the city endlinehere  long long must be our parting i was not destined to tell you my thoughts endlinehere  i stood on tiptoe gazing into the distance interminably gazing at the road that had taken you endlinehere  with thoughts of you my mind is obsessed in my dreams i see the light of your face endlinehere  now you are started on your long journey each day brings you further from me endlinehere  oh that i had a birds wings and high flying could follow you endlinehere  long i sob and long i cry the tears fall down and wet my skirt endlinehere  on the eastern way at the city of lo yang at the edge of the road peach trees and plum trees grow on the two sides flower matched by flower across the road leaf touching leaf endlinehere  a spring wind rises from the north east flowers and leaves gently nod and sway endlinehere  up the road somebodys daughter comes carrying a basket to gather silkworms food endlinehere  _she sees the fruit trees in blossom and forgetting about her silkworms begins to pluck the branches endlinehere  _ with her slender hand she breaks a branch from the tree the flowers fall tossed and scattered in the wind endlinehere  lovely lady i never did you harm why should you hate me and do me injury endlinehere  though in the autumn your leaves patter to the ground when spring comes your gay bloom returns endlinehere  but in mens lives when their bright youth is spent joy and love never come back again endlinehere  when i was young throughout the hot season there were no carriages driving about the roads endlinehere  people shut their doors and lay down in the cool or if they went out it was not to pay calls endlinehere  nowadays ill bred ignorant fellows when they feel the heat make for a friends house endlinehere  the unfortunate host when he hears someone coming scowls and frowns but can think of no escape endlinehere  theres nothing for it but to rise and go to the door and in his comfortable seat he groans and sighs endlinehere  the conversation does not end quickly prattling and babbling what a lot he says endlinehere  only when one is almost dead with fatigue he asks at last if one isnt finding him tiring endlinehere  ones arm is almost in half with continual fanning the sweat is pouring down ones neck in streams endlinehere  do not say that this is a small matter i consider the practice a blot on our social life endlinehere  i therefore caution all wise men that august visitors should not be admitted endlinehere  i look up and see his curtains and bed i look down and examine his table and mat endlinehere  the things are there just as before endlinehere  but the man they belonged to is not there endlinehere  his spirit suddenly has taken flight and left me behind far away endlinehere  to whom shall i look on whom rely endlinehere  my tears flow in an endless stream endlinehere  yu yu cry the wandering deer as they carry fodder to their young in the wood endlinehere  flap flap fly the birds as they carry their little ones back to the nest endlinehere  i alone am desolate dreading the days of our long parting my grieving hearts settled pain no one else can understand endlinehere  there is a saying among people sorrow makes us grow old endlinehere  alas alas for my white hairs endlinehere  all too early they have come endlinehere  long wailing long sighing my thoughts are fixed on my sage parent endlinehere  they say the good live long then why was he not spared endlinehere  my charioteer hastens to yoke my carriage for i must go on a journey far away endlinehere  where are you going on your journey far away endlinehere  to the land of wu where my enemies are endlinehere  but i must ride many thousand miles beyond the eastern road that leads to wu endlinehere  i want to take a skiff and cross these rivers but alas for me where shall i find a boat endlinehere  to sit idle is not my desire gladly enough would i go to my countrys aid endlinehere  in the north west there is a floating cloud stretched on high like a chariots canvas awning endlinehere  alas that i was born in these times to be blown along like a cloud puffed by the wind endlinehere  it has blown me away far to the south east on and on till i came to wu hui endlinehere  wu hui is not my country why should i go on staying and staying here endlinehere  i will give it up and never speak of it again this being abroad and always living in dread endlinehere  i climb to the ridge of pei mang mountain and look down on the city of lo yang endlinehere  in lo yang how still it is endlinehere  palaces and houses all burnt to ashes endlinehere  walls and fences all broken and gaping thorns and brambles shooting up to the sky endlinehere  i do not see the old old men i only see the new young men endlinehere  i turn aside for the straight road is lost the fields are overgrown and will never be ploughed again endlinehere  i have been away such a long time that i do not know which street is which endlinehere  how sad and ugly the empty moors are endlinehere  a thousand miles without the smoke of a chimney endlinehere  i think of the house i lived in all those years i am heart tied and cannot speak endlinehere  wondrous was the wall stone weirdly broken burgh steads bursten giants work tumbleth roofs are wrenched towers totter bereft of rune gates endlinehere  smoke is on the plaster scarred the shower burghs shorn and shattered by eld under eaten endlinehere  earths grip haveth wealders and workmen endlinehere  our wandering eyes are sated with the dancers skill endlinehere  our ears are weary with the sound of kung and shang endlinehere  our host is silent and sits doing nothing all the guests go on to places of amusement endlinehere  on long benches the sportsmen sit ranged round a cleared room watching the fighting cocks endlinehere  the gallant birds are all in battle trim they raise their tails and flap defiantly endlinehere  their beating wings stir the calm air their angry eyes gleam with a red light endlinehere  where their beaks have struck the fine feathers are scattered with their strong talons they wound again and again endlinehere  their long cries enter the blue clouds their flapping wings tirelessly beat and throb endlinehere  pray god the lamp oil lasts a little longer then i shall not leave without winning the match endlinehere  in the nine provinces there is not room enough i want to soar high among the clouds and far beyond the eight limits of the compass cast my gaze across the unmeasured void endlinehere  the doors of heaven swing open the double gates shine with a red light endlinehere  the lord god lies at his western lattice and the lesser spirits are together in the eastern gallery endlinehere  they wash me in a bath of rainbow spray and gird me with a belt of jasper and rubies endlinehere  i wander at my ease gathering divine herbs i bend down and touch the scented flowers endlinehere  wang tz gives me drugs of long life and hsien mn hands me strange potions endlinehere  by the partaking of food i evade the rites of death my span is extended to the enjoyment of life everlasting endlinehere  flap flap you curtain in front of our bed endlinehere  i hung you there to screen us from the light of day endlinehere  i brought you with me when i left my fathers house now i am taking you back with me again endlinehere  i will fold you up and lay you flat in your box endlinehere  curtain shall i ever take you out again endlinehere  when i was young i learnt fencing and was better at it than crooked castle endlinehere  my spirit was high as the rolling clouds and my fame resounded beyond the world endlinehere  i took my sword to the desert sands i drank my horse at the nine moors endlinehere  my flags and banners flapped in the wind and nothing was heard but the song of my drums endlinehere  war and its travels have made me sad and a fierce anger burns within me its thinking of how ive wasted my time that makes this fury tear my heart endlinehere  i will cast out wisdom and reject learning endlinehere  my thoughts shall wander in the great void _bis_ endlinehere  always repenting of wrongs done will never bring my heart to rest endlinehere  i cast my hook in a single stream but my joy is as though i possessed a kingdom endlinehere  i loose my hair and go singing to the four frontiers men join in my refrain endlinehere  this is the purport of my song my thoughts shall wander in the great void endlinehere  a gentle wind fans the calm night a bright moon shines on the high tower endlinehere  a voice whispers but no one answers when i call a shadow stirs but no one comes when i beckon endlinehere  the kitchen man brings in a dish of lentils wine is there but i do not fill my cup endlinehere  contentment with poverty is fortunes best gift riches and honour are the handmaids of disaster endlinehere  though gold and gems by the world are sought and prized to me they seem no more than weeds or chaff endlinehere  how sad it is to be a woman endlinehere  nothing on earth is held so cheap endlinehere  boys stand leaning at the door like gods fallen out of heaven endlinehere  their hearts brave the four oceans the wind and dust of a thousand miles endlinehere  no one is glad when a girl is born by _her_ the family sets no store endlinehere  when she grows up she hides in her room afraid to look a man in the face endlinehere  no one cries when she leaves her home sudden as clouds when the rain stops endlinehere  she bows her head and composes her face her teeth are pressed on her red lips she bows and kneels countless times endlinehere  she must humble herself even to the servants endlinehere  _his_ love is distant as the stars in heaven yet the sunflower bends toward the sun endlinehere  their hearts more sundered than water and fire a hundred evils are heaped upon her endlinehere  her face will follow the years changes her lord will find new pleasures endlinehere  they that were once like substance and shadow are now as far as hu from chin endlinehere  yet hu and chin shall sooner meet than they whose parting is like tsan and chn endlinehere  when i was young i played with a soft brush and was passionately devoted to reading all sorts of books endlinehere  but then the arrows began singing at the frontier endlinehere  and a winged summons came flying to the city endlinehere  although arms were not my profession i had once read jang chs war book endlinehere  i shouted aloud and my cries rent the air i felt as though tung wu were already annihilated endlinehere  the scholars knife cuts best at its first use and my dreams hurried on to the completion of my plan endlinehere  i wanted at a stroke to clear the yang tze and hsiang and at a glance to quell the tibetans and hu endlinehere  when my task was done i should not accept a barony but refusing with a bow retire to a cottage in the country endlinehere  flap flap the captive bird in the cage beating its wings against the four corners endlinehere  depressed depressed the scholar in the narrow street clasping a shadow he dwells in an empty house endlinehere  when he goes out there is nowhere for him to go bunches and brambles block up his path endlinehere  he composes a memorial but it is rejected and unread he is left stranded like a fish in a dry pond endlinehere  without he has not a single farthing of salary within there is not a peck of grain in his larder endlinehere  his relations upbraid him for his lack of success his friends and callers daily decrease in number endlinehere  i once hoped to pluck the fruits of life but now alas they are all withered and dry endlinehere  though one drinks at a river one cannot drink more than a bellyful enough is good but there is no use in satiety endlinehere  the bird in a forest can perch but on one bough and this should be the wise mans pattern endlinehere  at pei mang how they rise to heaven those high mounds four or five in the fields endlinehere  what men lie buried under these tombs endlinehere  all of them were lords of the han world endlinehere  when the dynasty was falling tumult and disorder arose thieves and robbers roamed like wild beasts endlinehere  of earth they have carried away more than one handful they have gone into vaults and opened the secret doors endlinehere  over everything the tangled thorns are growing a herd boy pushes through them up the path endlinehere  down in the thorns rabbits have made their burrows the weeds and thistles will never be cleared away endlinehere  over the tombs the ploughshare will be driven and peasants will have their fields and orchards there endlinehere  they that were once lords of a thousand hosts are now become the dust of the hills and ridges endlinehere  when i was alive i wandered in the streets of the capital now that i am dead i am left to lie in the fields endlinehere  in the morning i drove out from the high hall in the evening i lodged beneath the yellow springs endlinehere  when the white sun had sunk in the western chasm i hung up my chariot and rested my four horses endlinehere  now even the mighty maker of all could not bring the life back to my limbs endlinehere  shape and substance day by day will vanish hair and teeth will gradually fall away endlinehere  forever from of old men have been so and none born can escape this thing endlinehere  living in retirement beyond the world silently enjoying isolation i pull the rope of my door tighter and stuff my window with roots and ferns endlinehere  my spirit is tuned to the spring season at the fall of the year there is autumn in my heart endlinehere  thus imitating cosmic changes my cottage becomes a universe endlinehere  shady shady the wood in front of the hall at midsummer full of calm shadows endlinehere  the south wind follows summers train with its eddying puffs it blows open my coat endlinehere  i am free from ties and can live a life of retirement endlinehere  when i rise from sleep i play with books and harp endlinehere  the lettuce in the garden still grows moist of last years grain there is always plenty left endlinehere  self support should maintain strict limits more than enough is not what i want endlinehere  i grind millet and make good wine when the wine is heated i pour it out for myself endlinehere  my little children are playing at my side learning to talk they babble unformed sounds endlinehere  these things have made me happy again and i forget my lost cap of office endlinehere  distant distant i gaze at the white clouds with a deep yearning i think of the sages of antiquity endlinehere  in the quiet of the morning i heard a knock at my door i threw on my clothes and opened it myself endlinehere  i asked who it was who had come so early to see me he said he was a peasant coming with good intent endlinehere  he brought a present of wine and rice soup believing that i had fallen on evil days endlinehere  you live in rags under a thatched roof and seem to have no desire for a better lot endlinehere  the rest of mankind have all the same ambitions you too must learn to wallow in their mire endlinehere  old man i am impressed by what you say but my soul is not fashioned like other mens endlinehere  to drive in their rut i might perhaps learn to be untrue to myself could only lead to muddle endlinehere  let us drink and enjoy together the wine you have brought for my course is set and cannot now be altered endlinehere  a long time ago i went on a journey right to the corner of the eastern ocean endlinehere  the road there was long and winding and stormy waves barred my path endlinehere  what made me go this way endlinehere  hunger drove me into the world endlinehere  i tried hard to fill my belly and even a little seemed a lot endlinehere  but this was clearly a bad bargain so i went home and lived in idleness endlinehere  high and low wise and simple all busily hoard up the moments of life endlinehere  therefore i have to the uttermost exposed the bitterness both of substance and shadow and have made spirit show how by following nature we may dissolve this bitterness endlinehere  heaven and earth exist for ever mountains and rivers never change endlinehere  but herbs and trees in perpetual rotation are renovated and withered by the dews and frosts and man the wise man the divine shall he alone escape this law endlinehere  fortuitously appearing for a moment in the world he suddenly departs never to return endlinehere  how can he know that the friends he has left are missing him and thinking of him endlinehere  only the things that he used remain they look upon them and their tears flow endlinehere  me no magical arts can save though you may hope for a wizards aid endlinehere  i beg you listen to this advice when you can get wine be sure to drink it endlinehere  there is no way to preserve life endlinehere  drugs of immortality are instruments of folly endlinehere  i would gladly wander in paradise but it is far away and there is no road endlinehere  since the day that i was joined to you we have shared all our joys and pains endlinehere  while you rested in the shade i left you a while but till the end we shall be together endlinehere  our joint existence is impermanent sadly together we shall slip away endlinehere  that when the body decays fame should also go is a thought unendurable burning the heart endlinehere  let us strive and labour while yet we may to do some deed that men will praise endlinehere  wine may in truth dispel our sorrow but how compare it with lasting fame endlinehere  god can only set in motion he cannot control the things he has made endlinehere  man the second of the three orders owes his precedence to me endlinehere  though i am different from you we were born involved in one another nor by any means can we escape the intimate sharing of good and ill endlinehere  the three emperors were saintly men yet to day where are they endlinehere  png lived to a great age yet he went at last when he longed to stay endlinehere  and late or soon all go wise and simple have no reprieve endlinehere  wine may bring forgetfulness but does it not hasten old age endlinehere  if you set your heart on noble deeds how do you know that any will praise you endlinehere  chill and harsh the year draws to its close in my cotton dress i seek sunlight on the porch endlinehere  in the southern orchard all the leaves are gone in the north garden rotting boughs lie heaped endlinehere  i empty my cup and drink it down to the dregs i look towards the kitchen but no smoke rises endlinehere  poems and books lie piled beside my chair but the light is going and i shall not have time to read them endlinehere  my life here is not like the agony in chn but often i have to bear bitter reproaches endlinehere  let me then remember to calm my hearts distress that the sages of old were often in like case endlinehere  white hair covers my temples i am wrinkled and seared beyond repair and though i have got five sons they all hate paper and brush endlinehere  a shu is eighteen for laziness there is none like him endlinehere  a hsan does his best but really loathes the fine arts endlinehere  but does not know six from seven endlinehere  tung tz in his ninth year is only concerned with things to eat endlinehere  if heaven treats me like this what can i do but fill my cup endlinehere  i built my hut in a zone of human habitation yet near me there sounds no noise of horse or coach endlinehere  would you know how that is possible endlinehere  a heart that is distant creates a wilderness round it endlinehere  i pluck chrysanthemums under the eastern hedge then gaze long at the distant summer hills endlinehere  the mountain air is fresh at the dusk of day the flying birds two by two return endlinehere  in these things there lies a deep meaning yet when we would express it words suddenly fail us endlinehere  my old desire to live in the southern village was not because i had taken a fancy to the house endlinehere  but i heard it was a place of simple minded men with whom it were a joy to spend the mornings and evenings endlinehere  many years i had longed to settle here now at last i have managed to move house endlinehere  i do not mind if my cottage is rather small so long as theres room enough for bed and mat endlinehere  often and often the neighbours come to see me and with brave words discuss the things of old endlinehere  rare writings we read together and praise doubtful meanings we examine together and settle endlinehere  when i was young i was out of tune with the herd my only love was for the hills and mountains endlinehere  unwitting i fell into the web of the worlds dust and was not free until my thirtieth year endlinehere  the migrant bird longs for the old wood the fish in the tank thinks of its native pool endlinehere  i had rescued from wildness a patch of the southern moor and still rustic i returned to field and garden endlinehere  my ground covers no more than ten acres my thatched cottage has eight or nine rooms endlinehere  elms and willows cluster by the eaves peach trees and plum trees grow before the hall endlinehere  hazy hazy the distant hamlets of men endlinehere  steady the smoke of the half deserted village a dog barks somewhere in the deep lanes a cock crows at the top of the mulberry tree endlinehere  at gate and courtyard no murmur of the worlds dust in the empty rooms leisure and deep stillness endlinehere  long i lived checked by the bars of a cage now i have turned again to nature and freedom endlinehere  in the month of june the grass grows high and round my cottage thick leaved branches sway endlinehere  there is not a bird but delights in the place where it rests and i too love my thatched cottage endlinehere  i have done my ploughing i have sown my seed endlinehere  again i have time to sit and read my books endlinehere  in the narrow lane there are no deep ruts often my friends carriages turn back endlinehere  in high spirits i pour out my spring wine and pluck the lettuce growing in my garden endlinehere  a gentle rain comes stealing up from the east and a sweet wind bears it company endlinehere  my thoughts float idly over the story of king chou my eyes wander over the pictures of hills and seas endlinehere  at a single glance i survey the whole universe endlinehere  he will never be happy whom such pleasures fail to please endlinehere  the lingering clouds rolling rolling and the settled rain dripping dripping in the eight directions the same dusk endlinehere  the level lands one great river endlinehere  wine i have wine i have idly i drink at the eastern window endlinehere  longingly i think of my friends but neither boat nor carriage comes endlinehere  swiftly the years beyond recall endlinehere  solemn the stillness of this fair morning endlinehere  i will clothe myself in spring clothing and visit the slopes of the eastern hill endlinehere  by the mountain stream a mist hovers hovers a moment then scatters endlinehere  there comes a wind blowing from the south that brushes the fields of new corn endlinehere  i collected together all my friends endlinehere  loud talk and simple feasting discussion of philosophy investigation of subtleties endlinehere  tongues loosened and minds at one endlinehere  hearts refreshed by discharge of emotion endlinehere  high rises the eastern peak soaring up to the blue sky endlinehere  among the rocks an empty hollow secret still mysterious endlinehere  uncarved and unhewn screened by nature with a roof of clouds endlinehere  times and seasons what things are you bringing to my life ceaseless change endlinehere  i will lodge for ever in this hollow where springs and autumns unheeded pass endlinehere  all night i could not sleep because of the moonlight on my bed endlinehere  i kept on hearing a voice calling out of nowhere nothing answered yes endlinehere  i will carry my coat and not put on my belt with unpainted eyebrows i will stand at the front window endlinehere  my tiresome petticoat keeps on flapping about if it opens a little i shall blame the spring wind endlinehere  i heard my love was going to yang chou and went with him as far as chu shan endlinehere  for a moment when you held me fast in your outstretched arms i thought the river stood still and did not flow endlinehere  i have brought my pillow and am lying at the northern window so come to me and play with me awhile endlinehere  with so much quarrelling and so few kisses how long do you think our love can last endlinehere  her door opened on the white water close by the side of the timber bridge thats where the little lady lived all alone without a lover endlinehere  green rushes with red shoots long leaves bending to the wind you and i in the same boat plucking rushes at the five lakes endlinehere  we started at dawn from the orchid island we rested under the elms till noon endlinehere  you and i plucking rushes had not plucked a handful when night came endlinehere  seeing the plum tree i thought of the western island and i plucked a branch to send to the north country endlinehere  i put on my dress of apricot yellow silk and bound up my hair black as the crows wing endlinehere  but which is the road that leads to the western island endlinehere  ill ask the man at the ferry by the bridge of boats endlinehere  but the sun is sinking and the orioles flying home and the wind is blowing and sighing in the walnut tree endlinehere  ill stand under the tree just beside the gate ill stand by the door and show off my enamelled hair pins endlinehere  shes opened the gate but her lover has not come shes gone out at the gate to pluck red lotus endlinehere  as she plucks the lotus on the southern dyke in autumn the lotus flowers stand higher than a mans head endlinehere  she bends down and plays with the lotus seeds the lotus seeds are green like the lake water endlinehere  she gathers the flowers and puts them into her gown the lotus bud that is red all through endlinehere  she thinks of her lover her lover that does not come she looks up and sees the wild geese flying the western island is full of wild geese endlinehere  to look for her lover she climbs the blue tower endlinehere  the tower is high she looks but cannot see all day she leans on the balcony rails endlinehere  the rail is twisted into a twelve fold pattern endlinehere  she lets fall her hand white like the colour of jade endlinehere  she rolls up the awning she sees the wide sky and the sea water waving its vacant blue endlinehere  the sea shall carry my dreams far away so that you shall be sorry at last for my sorrow endlinehere  if the south wind only knew my thoughts it would blow my dreams till they got to the western island endlinehere  i was brought up under the stone castle my window opened on to the castle tower endlinehere  in the castle were beautiful young men who waved to me as they went in and out endlinehere  chiang nan is a glorious and beautiful land and chin ling an exalted and kingly province endlinehere  the green canals of the city stretch on and on and its high towers stretch up and up endlinehere  flying gables lean over the bridle road drooping willows cover the royal aqueduct endlinehere  shrill flutes sing by the coachs awning and reiterated drums bang near its painted wheels endlinehere  the names of the deserving shall be carved on the cloud terrace endlinehere  and for those who have done valiantly rich reward awaits endlinehere  now late i follow times necessity mounting a barricade i pacify remote tribes endlinehere  discarding my sash i don a coat of rhinoceros skin rolling up my skirts i shoulder a black bow endlinehere  even at the very start my strength fails what will become of me before its all over endlinehere  red hills lie athwart us as a menace in the west and fiery mountains glare terrible in the south endlinehere  the body burns the head aches and throbs if a bird light here its soul forthwith departs endlinehere  warm springs pour from cloudy pools and hot smoke issues between the rocks endlinehere  the sun and moon are perpetually obscured the rain and dew never stay dry endlinehere  there are red serpents a hundred feet long and black snakes ten girths round endlinehere  the sand spitters shoot their poison at the sunbeams the flying insects are ill with the shifting glare endlinehere  the hungry monkeys dare not come down to eat the morning birds dare not set out to fly endlinehere  at the ching river many die of poison crossing the lu one is lucky if one is only ill endlinehere  our living feet walk on dead ground our high wills surmount the snares of fate endlinehere  the spear boat general got but little honour the wave subduer met with scant reward endlinehere  if our prince still grudges the things that are easy to give can he hope that his soldiers will give what is hardest to give endlinehere  i heard at night your long sighs and knew that you were thinking of me endlinehere  as she spoke the doors of heaven opened and our souls conversed and i saw her face endlinehere  she set me a pillow to rest on and she brought me meat and drink endlinehere  i stood beside her where she lay but suddenly woke and she was not there and none knew how my soul was torn how the tears fell surging over my breast endlinehere  in the high trees many doleful winds the ocean waters lashed into waves endlinehere  if the sharp sword be not in your hand how can you hope your friends will remain many endlinehere  do you not see that sparrow on the fence endlinehere  seeing the hawk it casts itself into the snare endlinehere  the fowler to catch the sparrow is delighted the young man to see the sparrow is grieved endlinehere  he takes his sword and cuts through the netting the yellow sparrow flies away away endlinehere  away away up to the blue sky and down again to thank the young man endlinehere  a beautiful place is the town of lo yang the big streets are full of spring light endlinehere  the lads go driving out with harps in their hands the mulberry girls go out to the fields with their baskets endlinehere  golden whips glint at the horses flanks endlinehere  gauze sleeves brush the green boughs endlinehere  racing dawn the carriages come home and the girls with their high baskets full of fruit endlinehere  my bed is so empty that i keep on waking up as the cold increases the night wind begins to blow endlinehere  it rustles the curtains making a noise like the sea oh that those were waves which could carry me back to you endlinehere  entering the hall she meets the new wife leaving the gate she runs into her former husband endlinehere  words stick she does not manage to say anything she presses her hands together and hesitates endlinehere  agitates moon like fan sheds pearl like tears realizes she loves him just as much as ever that her present pain will never come to an end endlinehere  who says that its by my desire this separation this living so far from you endlinehere  my dress still smells of the lavender you gave my hand still holds the letter that you sent endlinehere  round my waist i wear a double sash i dream that it binds us both with a same heart knot endlinehere  did not you know that people hide their love like a flower that seems too precious to be picked endlinehere  of marsh mallows my boat is made the ropes are lily roots endlinehere  the pole star is athwart the sky the moon sinks low endlinehere  its at the ferry im plucking lilies endlinehere  but it might be the yellow river so afraid you seem of the wind and waves so long you tarry at the crossing endlinehere  the road that i came by mounts eight thousand feet the river that i crossed hangs a hundred fathoms endlinehere  the brambles so thick that in summer one cannot pass endlinehere  the snow so high that in winter one cannot climb endlinehere  with branches that interlace lung valley is dark against cliffs that tower ones voice beats and echoes endlinehere  i turn my head and it seems only a dream that i ever lived in the streets of hsien yang endlinehere  the evening river is level and motionless the spring colours just open to their full endlinehere  suddenly a wave carries the moon away and the tidal water comes with its freight of stars endlinehere  kao huan that son of a mouse dared to attack king pi endlinehere  but at the first stroke of sword and bow the aggressors plot recoiled on himself endlinehere  tchirek river lies under the dark mountains where the sky is like the sides of a tent stretched down over the great steppe endlinehere  the sky is gray gray and the steppe wide wide over grass that the wind has battered low sheep and oxen roam endlinehere  business men boast of their skill and cunning but in philosophy they are like little children endlinehere  bragging to each other of successful depredations they neglect to consider the ultimate fate of the body endlinehere  tell me now what should a man want but to sit alone sipping his cup of wine endlinehere  then i could jog through a happy five score years and at the end need no paradise endlinehere  these days continually fuddled with drink i fail to satisfy the appetites of the soul endlinehere  but seeing men all behaving like drunkards how can i alone remain sober endlinehere  his subjects were always original but his poems are seldom worth quoting is a chinese opinion of him endlinehere  i loved you dearly stone fish lake with your rock island shaped like a swimming fish endlinehere  on the fishs back is the wine cup hollow and round the fish the flowing waters of the lake endlinehere  the boys on the shore sent little wooden ships each made to carry a single cup of wine endlinehere  the island drinkers emptied the liquor boats and set their sails and sent them back for more endlinehere  on the shores of the lake were jutting slabs of rock and under the rocks there flowed an icy stream endlinehere  heated with wine to rinse our mouths and hands in those cold waters was a joy beyond compare endlinehere  of gold and jewels i have not any need for caps and coaches i do not care at all endlinehere  but i wish i could sit on the rocky banks of the lake for ever and ever staring at the stone fish endlinehere  above the lake are deep mountain valleys and men dwelling whose hearts are without guile endlinehere  gay like children they swarm to the tops of the trees and run to the water to catch bream and trout endlinehere  their pleasures are the same as those of beasts and birds they put no restraint either on body or mind endlinehere  far i have wandered throughout the nine lands wherever i went such manners had disappeared endlinehere  i find myself standing and wondering perplexed whether saints and sages have really done us good endlinehere  the hills and rivers of the lowland country you have made your battle ground endlinehere  how do you suppose the people who live there will procure firewood and hay endlinehere  do not let me hear you talking together about titles and promotions for a single generals reputation is made out of ten thousand corpses endlinehere  families when a child is born want it to be intelligent endlinehere  i through intelligence having wrecked my whole life only hope the baby will prove ignorant and stupid endlinehere  then he will crown a tranquil life by becoming a cabinet minister endlinehere  an old man selling charms in a cranny of the town wall endlinehere  he writes out spells to bless the silkworms and spells to protect the corn endlinehere  with the money he gets each day he only buys wine endlinehere  but he does not worry when his legs get wobbly for he has a boy to lean on endlinehere  away and away i sail in my light boat my heart leaps with a great gust of joy endlinehere  through the leafless branches i see the temple in the wood over the dwindling stream the stone bridge towers endlinehere  down the grassy lanes sheep and oxen pass in the misty village cranes and magpies cry endlinehere  back in my home i drink a cup of wine and need not fear the greed of the evening wind endlinehere  in the southern village the boy who minds the ox with his naked feet stands on the oxs back endlinehere  through the hole in his coat the river wind blows through his broken hat the mountain rain pours endlinehere  on the long dyke he seemed to be far away in the narrow lane suddenly we were face to face endlinehere  the boy is home and the ox is back in its stall and a dark smoke oozes through the thatched roof endlinehere  of spring water thirty or forty miles in the evening sunlight three or four houses endlinehere  youths and boys minding geese and ducks women and girls tending mulberries and hemp endlinehere  the place remote their coats and scarves old the year fruitful their talk and laughter gay endlinehere  the old wanderer moors his flat boat and staggers up the bank to pluck wistaria flowers endlinehere  the little cart jolting and banging through the yellow haze of dusk endlinehere  the man pushing behind the woman pulling in front endlinehere  they have left the city and do not know where to go endlinehere  green green those elm tree leaves _they_ will cure my hunger if only we could find some quiet place and sup on them together endlinehere  the wind has flattened the yellow mother wort above it in the distance they see the walls of a house endlinehere  _there_ surely must be people living wholl give you something to eat endlinehere  they tap at the door but no one comes they look in but the kitchen is empty endlinehere  they stand hesitating in the lonely road and their tears fall like rain endlinehere  since i left my home to seek official state seven years i have lived in chang an endlinehere  what have i gained endlinehere  we have roamed on horseback under the flowering trees we have walked in the snow and warmed our hearts with wine endlinehere  we have met and parted at the western gate and neither of us bothered to put on cap or belt endlinehere  we did not go up together for examination we were not serving in the same department of state endlinehere  the bond that joined us lay deeper than outward things the rivers of our souls spring from the same well endlinehere  i look down on the twelve city streets red dust flanked by green trees endlinehere  coaches and horsemen alone fill my eyes i do not see whom my heart longs to see endlinehere  of all that walk on the north south road there is not one that i care for more than the rest endlinehere  at the palace doors the smell of meat and wine on the road the bones of one who was frozen to death endlinehere  ten leagues riding always facing to the north the cold wind almost blew off my ears endlinehere  i waited for the bell outside the five gates i waited for the summons within the triple hall endlinehere  my hair and beard were frozen and covered with icicles my coat and robe chilly like water endlinehere  at the western window i paused from writing rescripts the pines and bamboos were all buried in stillness endlinehere  the moon rose and a calm wind came suddenly it was like an evening in the hills endlinehere  and so as i dozed i dreamed of the south west and thought i was staying at the hsien yu temple endlinehere  when i woke and heard the dripping of the palace clock i still thought it the murmur of a mountain stream endlinehere  the snow has gone from chung nan spring is almost come endlinehere  lovely in the distance its blue colours against the brown of the streets endlinehere  a thousand coaches ten thousand horsemen pass down the nine roads turns his head and looks at the mountains not one man endlinehere  we talked together in the yung shou temple we parted to the north of the hsin chang dyke endlinehere  going home i shed a few tears grieving about things not sorry for you endlinehere  long long the road to lan tien you said yourself you would not be able to write endlinehere  reckoning up your halts for eating and sleeping by this time youve crossed the shang mountains endlinehere  last night the clouds scattered away a thousand leagues the same moonlight scene endlinehere  when dawn came i dreamt i saw your face it must have been that you were thinking of me endlinehere  in my dream i thought i held your hand and asked you to tell me what your thoughts were endlinehere  and _you_ said i miss you bitterly but theres no one here to send to you with a letter endlinehere  when i awoke before i had time to speak a knocking on the door sounded doong doong endlinehere  they came and told me a messenger from shang chou had brought a letter a single scroll from you endlinehere  up from my pillow i suddenly sprang out of bed and threw you my clothes all topsy turvy endlinehere  i undid the knot and saw the letter within a single sheet with thirteen lines of writing endlinehere  at the top it told the sorrows of an exiles heart at the bottom it described the pains of separation endlinehere  the sorrows and pains took up so much space there was no room left to talk about the weather endlinehere  but you said that when you wrote you were staying for the night to the east of shang chou sitting alone lighted by a solitary candle lodging in the mountain hostel of yang chng endlinehere  night was late when you finished writing the mountain moon was slanting towards the west endlinehere  what is it lies aslant across the moon endlinehere  a single tree of purple _paulovnia_ flowers paulovnia flowers just on the point of falling are a symbol to express thinking of an absent friend endlinehere  lovingly you wrote on the back side to send in the letter your poem of the paulovnia flower endlinehere  the poem of the paulovnia flower has eight rhymes yet these eight couplets have cast a spell on my heart endlinehere  they have taken hold of this mornings thoughts and carried them to yours the night you wrote your letter endlinehere  the whole poem i read three times each verse ten times i recite endlinehere  so precious to me are the fourscore words that each letter changes into a bar of gold endlinehere  when the yellow birds note was almost stopped and half formed the green plums fruit sitting and grieving that spring things were over i rose and entered the eastern gardens gate endlinehere  i carried my cup and was dully drinking alone suddenly i heard a knocking sound at the door endlinehere  dwelling secluded i was glad that someone had come how much the more when i saw it was chn hsiung endlinehere  at ease and leisure all day we talked crowding and jostling the feelings of many years endlinehere  how great a thing is a single cup of wine endlinehere  for it makes us tell the story of our whole lives endlinehere  when i was almost forty i had a daughter whose name was golden bells endlinehere  now it is just a year since she was born she is learning to sit and cannot yet talk endlinehere  ashamed to find that i have not a sages heart i cannot resist vulgar thoughts and feelings endlinehere  henceforward i am tied to things outside myself my only reward the pleasure i am getting now endlinehere  if i am spared the grief of her dying young then i shall have the trouble of getting her married endlinehere  my plan for retiring and going back to the hills must now be postponed for fifteen years endlinehere  ruined and ill a man of two score pretty and guileless a girl of three endlinehere  not a boy but still better than nothing to soothe ones feeling from time to time a kiss endlinehere  there came a day they suddenly took her from me her souls shadow wandered i know not where endlinehere  at last by thinking of the time before she was born by thought and reason i drove the pain away endlinehere  since my heart forgot her many days have passed and three times winter has changed to spring endlinehere  this morning for a little the old grief came back because in the road i met her foster nurse endlinehere  sad sad lean with long illness monotonous monotonous days and nights pass endlinehere  the summer trees have clad themselves in shade the autumn lan already houses the dew endlinehere  the eggs that lay in the nest when i took to bed have changed into little birds and flown away endlinehere  the worm that then lay hidden in its hole has hatched into a cricket sitting on the tree endlinehere  the four seasons go on for ever and ever in all nature nothing stops to rest even for a moment endlinehere  only the sick mans heart deep down still aches as of old endlinehere  deep the waters of the black pool coloured like ink they say a holy dragon lives there whom men have never seen endlinehere  beside the pool they have built a shrine the authorities have established a ritual a dragon by itself remains a dragon but men can make it a god endlinehere  prosperity and disaster rain and drought plagues and pestilences by the village people were all regarded as the sacred dragons doing endlinehere  they all made offerings of sucking pig and poured libations of wine the morning prayers and evening gifts depended on a mediums advice when the dragon comes ah endlinehere  the wind stirs and sighs paper money thrown ah endlinehere  silk umbrellas waved endlinehere  when the dragon goes ah endlinehere  the wind also still endlinehere  the cups and vessels are cold endlinehere  meats lie stacked on the rocks of the pools shore wine flows on the grass in front of the shrine endlinehere  i do not know of all those offerings how much the dragon eats but the mice of the woods and the foxes of the hills are continually drunk and sated endlinehere  why are the foxes so lucky endlinehere  what have the sucking pigs done that year by year _they_ should be killed merely to glut the foxes endlinehere  that the foxes are robbing the sacred dragon and eating his sucking pig beneath the nine fold depths of his pool does he know or not endlinehere  there came an officer knocking by night at my door in a loud voice demanding grain tribute endlinehere  my house servants dared not wait till the morning but brought candles and set them on the barn floor endlinehere  passed through the sieve clean washed as pearls a whole cart load thirty bushels of grain endlinehere  but still they cry that it is not paid in full with whips and curses they goad my servants and boys endlinehere  once in error i entered public life i am inwardly ashamed that my talents were not sufficient endlinehere  in succession i occupied four official posts for doing nothing ten years salary endlinehere  often have i heard that saying of ancient men that good and ill follow in an endless chain endlinehere  and to day it ought to set my heart at rest to return to others the corn in my great barn endlinehere  in the land of tao chou many of the people are dwarfs the tallest of them never grow to more than three feet endlinehere  they were sold in the market as dwarf slaves and yearly sent to court described as an offering of natural products from the land of tao chou endlinehere  a strange offering of natural products i never heard of one yet that parted men from those they loved never to meet again endlinehere  old men weeping for their grandsons mothers for their children endlinehere  one day yang chng came to govern the land he refused to send up dwarf slaves in spite of incessant mandates endlinehere  the emperors heart was deeply moved and he sealed and sent a scroll the yearly tribute of dwarfish slaves is henceforth annulled endlinehere  the people of tao chou old ones and young ones how great their joy endlinehere  father with son and brother with brother henceforward kept together from that day for ever more they lived as free men endlinehere  the people of tao chou still enjoy this gift endlinehere  and even now when they speak of the governor tears start to their eyes endlinehere  and lest their children and their childrens children should forget the governors name when boys are born the syllable yang is often used in their forename endlinehere  of cord and cassia wood is the harp compounded within it lie ancient melodies endlinehere  ancient melodies weak and savourless not appealing to present mens taste endlinehere  light and colour are faded from the jade stops dust has covered the rose red strings endlinehere  decay and ruin came to it long ago but the sound that is left is still cold and clear endlinehere  i do not refuse to play it if you want me to but even if i play people will not listen endlinehere  how did it come to be neglected so endlinehere  because of the chiang flute and the chin flageolet endlinehere  the singers have hushed their notes of clear song the red sleeves of the dancers are motionless endlinehere  hugging his lute the old harper of chao rocks and sways as he touches the five chords endlinehere  the loud notes swell and scatter abroad sa sa like wind blowing the rain endlinehere  the soft notes dying almost to nothing chieh chieh like the voice of ghosts talking endlinehere  now as glad as the magpies lucky song again bitter as the gibbons ominous cry endlinehere  and those who sit and listen to the tune he plays of soul and body lose the mastery endlinehere  and those who pass that way as he plays the tune suddenly stop and cannot raise their feet endlinehere  alas alas that the ears of common men should love the modern and not love the old endlinehere  thus it is that the harp in the green window day by day is covered deeper with dust endlinehere  in the royal city spring is almost over tinkle tinkle the coaches and horsemen pass endlinehere  we tell each other this is the peony season and follow with the crowd that goes to the flower market endlinehere  cheap and dear no uniform price the cost of the plant depends on the number of blossoms endlinehere  for the fine flower a hundred pieces of damask for the cheap flower five bits of silk endlinehere  above is spread an awning to protect them around is woven a wattle fence to screen them endlinehere  if you sprinkle water and cover the roots with mud when they are transplanted they will not lose their beauty endlinehere  each household thoughtlessly follows the custom man by man no one realizing endlinehere  there happened to be an old farm labourer who came by chance that way endlinehere  he bowed his head and sighed a deep sigh but this sigh nobody understood endlinehere  he was thinking a cluster of deep red flowers would pay the taxes of ten poor houses endlinehere  tartars led in chains tartars led in chains endlinehere  their ears pierced their faces bruised they are driven into the land of chin endlinehere  the son of heaven took pity on them and would not have them slain endlinehere  a petty officer in a yellow coat took down their names and surnames they were led from the city of chang an under escort of an armed guard endlinehere  their bodies were covered with the wounds of arrows their bones stood out from their cheeks endlinehere  they had grown so weak they could only march a single stage a day endlinehere  in the morning they must satisfy hunger and thirst with neither plate nor cup at night they must lie in their dirt and rags on beds that stank with filth endlinehere  suddenly they came to the yangtze river and remembered the waters of chiao endlinehere  with lowered hands and levelled voices they sobbed a muffled song endlinehere  then one tartar lifted up his voice and spoke to the other tartars _your_ sorrows are none at all compared with _my_ sorrows endlinehere  those that were with him in the same band asked to hear his tale as he tried to speak the words were choked by anger endlinehere  he told them i was born and bred in the town of liang yan endlinehere  in the frontier wars of ta li i fell into the tartars hands endlinehere  since the days the tartars took me alive forty years have passed they put me into a coat of skins tied with a belt of rope endlinehere  only on the first of the first month might i wear my chinese dress endlinehere  as i put on my coat and arranged my cap how fast the tears flowed endlinehere  i made in my heart a secret vow i would find a way home i hid my plan from my tartar wife and the children she had borne me in the land endlinehere  i thought to myself it is well for me that my limbs are still strong and yet being old in my heart i feared i should never live to return endlinehere  the tartar chieftains shoot so well that the birds are afraid to fly from the risk of their arrows i escaped alive and fled swiftly home endlinehere  hiding all day and walking all night i crossed the great desert where clouds are dark and the moon black and the sands eddy in the wind endlinehere  but the moving horsemen did not hear that i spoke the han tongue their captain took me for a tartar born and had me bound in chains endlinehere  they are sending me away to the south east to a low and swampy land no one now will take pity on me resistance is all in vain endlinehere  thinking of this my voice chokes and i ask of heaven above was i spared from death only to spend the rest of my years in sorrow endlinehere  my native village of liang yan i shall not see again my wife and children in the tartars land i have fruitlessly deserted endlinehere  when i fell among tartars and was taken prisoner i pined for the land of han now that i am back in the land of han they have turned me into a tartar endlinehere  had i but known what my fate would be i would not have started home endlinehere  for the two lands so wide apart are alike in the sorrow they bring endlinehere  tartar prisoners in chains endlinehere  of all the sorrows of all the prisoners mine is the hardest to bear endlinehere  never in the world has so great a wrong befallen the lot of man a han heart and a han tongue set in the body of a turk endlinehere  a government bull yoked to a government cart endlinehere  moored by the bank of chan river a barge loaded with gravel endlinehere  a single load of gravel how many pounds it weighs endlinehere  carrying at dawn carrying at dusk what is it all for endlinehere  they are carrying it towards the five gates to the west of the main road endlinehere  under the shadow of green laurels they are making a gravel drive endlinehere  for yesterday arrove newly appointed the assistant chancellor of the realm and was terribly afraid that the wet and mud would dirty his horses hoofs endlinehere  the chancellors horses hoofs stepped on the gravel and remained perfectly clean but the bull employed in dragging the cart was almost sweating blood endlinehere  the assistant chancellors business is to save men govern the country and harmonize yin and yang endlinehere  whether the bulls neck is sore need not trouble him at all endlinehere  there was once a man who dreamt he went to heaven his dream body soared aloft through space endlinehere  he rode on the back of a white plumed crane and was led on his flight by two crimson banners endlinehere  whirring of wings and flapping of coat tails endlinehere  jade bells suddenly all a tinkle endlinehere  half way to heaven he looked down beneath him down on the dark turmoil of the world endlinehere  gradually he lost the place of his native town mountains and water nothing else distinct endlinehere  the eastern ocean a single strip of white the hills of china five specks of green endlinehere  gliding past him a host of fairies swept in long procession to the palace of the jade city endlinehere  they take him to the presence of the mighty jade emperor he bows his head and proffers loyal homage endlinehere  the emperor says we see you have fairy talents be of good heart and do not slight yourself endlinehere  we shall send to fetch you in fifteen years and give you a place in the courtyard of immortality endlinehere  twice bowing he acknowledged the gracious words then woke from sleep full of wonder and joy endlinehere  he hid his secret and dared not tell it abroad but vowed a vow he would live in a cave of rock endlinehere  from love and affection he severed kith and kin from his eating and drinking he omitted savoury and spice endlinehere  his morning meal was a dish of coral dust at night he sipped an essence of dewy mists endlinehere  in the empty mountains he lived for thirty years daily watching for the heavenly coach to come endlinehere  the time of appointment was already long past but of wings and coach bells still no sound endlinehere  his teeth and hair daily withered and decayed his ears and eyes gradually lost their keenness endlinehere  one morning he suffered the common change and his body was one with the dust and dirt of the hill endlinehere  gods and fairies endlinehere  if indeed such things there be their ways are beyond the striving of mortal men endlinehere  though you sweat and toil what shall your trouble bring endlinehere  you will only shorten the five score years of your span endlinehere  sad alas the man who dreamt of fairies endlinehere  for a single dream spoiled his whole life endlinehere  boundless the great sea endlinehere  straight down no bottom sideways no border endlinehere  of cloudy waves and misty billows down in the uttermost depths men have fabled in the midst there stand three sacred hills endlinehere  on the hills thick growing herbs that banish death endlinehere  wings grow on those who eat them and they turn into heavenly hsien endlinehere  the lord of chin and wu of han believed in these stories and magic workers year by year were sent to gather the herbs endlinehere  the blessed islands now and of old what but an empty tale endlinehere  the misty waters spread before them and they knew not where to seek endlinehere  dauntless the mighty wind endlinehere  their eyes search but cannot see the shores of the blessed islands endlinehere  they cannot find the blessed isles and yet they dare not return youths and maidens that began the quest grew grey on board the boat endlinehere  do you not see the graves on the top of black horse hill and the tombs at mo ling endlinehere  what is left but the sighing wind blowing in the tangled grasses endlinehere  the two red towers north and south rise facing each other endlinehere  i beg to ask to whom do they belong endlinehere  the two princes blew on their flutes and drew down fairies from the sky who carried them off through the five clouds soaring away to heaven endlinehere  their halls and houses that they could not take with them were turned into temples planted in the dust of the world endlinehere  in the tiring rooms and dancers towers all is silent and still only the willows like dancers arms and the pond like a mirror endlinehere  when the flowers are falling at yellow twilight when things are sad and hushed one does not hear songs and flutes but only chimes and bells endlinehere  the imperial patent on the temple doors is written in letters of gold for nuns quarters and monks cells ample space is allowed endlinehere  for green moss and bright moonlight plenty of room provided in a hovel opposite is a sick man who has hardly room to lie down endlinehere  i remember once when at ping yang they were building a great mans house how it swallowed up the housing space of thousands of ordinary men endlinehere  the immortals are leaving us two by two and their houses are turned into temples i begin to fear that the whole world will become a vast convent endlinehere  an old charcoal seller cutting wood and burning charcoal in the forests of the southern mountain endlinehere  his face stained with dust and ashes has turned to the colour of smoke endlinehere  the hair on his temples is streaked with gray his ten fingers are black endlinehere  the money he gets by selling charcoal how far does it go endlinehere  it is just enough to clothe his limbs and put food in his mouth endlinehere  although alas the coat on his back is a coat without lining endlinehere  he hopes for the coming of cold weather to send up the price of coal endlinehere  last night outside the city a whole foot of snow at dawn he drives the charcoal wagon along the frozen ruts endlinehere  oxen weary man hungry the sun already high outside the gate to the south of the market at last they stop in the mud endlinehere  suddenly a pair of prancing horsemen endlinehere  who can it be coming endlinehere  a public official in a yellow coat and a boy in a white shirt endlinehere  in their hands they hold a written warrant on their tongues the words of an order they turn back the wagon and curse the oxen leading them off to the north endlinehere  a whole wagon of charcoal more than a thousand pieces endlinehere  if officials choose to take it away the woodman may not complain endlinehere  half a piece of red silk and a single yard of damask the courtiers have tied to the oxens collar as the price of a wagon of coal endlinehere  i was going to the city to sell the herbs i had plucked on the way i rested by some trees at the blue gate endlinehere  along the road there came a horseman riding whose face was pale with a strange look of dread endlinehere  friends and relations waiting to say good bye pressed at his side but he did not dare to pause endlinehere  i in wonder asked the people about me who he was and what had happened to him endlinehere  they told me this was a privy councillor whose grave duties were like the pivot of state endlinehere  his food allowance was ten thousand cash three times a day the emperor came to his house endlinehere  yesterday he was called to a meeting of heroes to day he is banished to the country of yai chou endlinehere  so always the counsellors of kings favour and ruin changed between dawn and dusk endlinehere  green green the grass of the eastern suburb and amid the grass a road that leads to the hills endlinehere  resting in peace among the white clouds at last he has made a coup that cannot fail endlinehere  at hsin fng an old man four score and eight the hair on his head and the hair of his eyebrows white as the new snow endlinehere  leaning on the shoulders of his great grandchildren he walks in front of the inn with his left arm he leans on their shoulders his right arm is broken endlinehere  i asked the old man how many years had passed since he broke his arm i also asked the cause of the injury how and why it happened endlinehere  the old man said he was born and reared in the district of hsin fng at the time of his birth a wise reign no wars or discords endlinehere  often i listened in the pear tree garden to the sound of flute and song naught i knew of banner and lance nothing of arrow or bow endlinehere  then came the wars of tien pao and the great levy of men of three men in each house one man was taken endlinehere  and those to whom the lot fell where were they taken to endlinehere  when the great army waded across the water seethed like a cauldron when barely ten had entered the water two or three were dead endlinehere  to the north of my village to the south of my village the sound of weeping and wailing endlinehere  children parting from fathers and mothers husbands parting from wives endlinehere  everyone says that in expeditions against the min tribes of a million men who are sent out not one returns endlinehere  i that am old was then twenty four my name and fore name were written down in the rolls of the board of war endlinehere  in the depth of the night not daring to let any one know i secretly took a huge stone and dashed it against my arm endlinehere  bones broken and sinews wounded could not fail to hurt i was ready enough to bear pain if only i got back home endlinehere  my arm broken ever since it was sixty years ago endlinehere  one limb although destroyed whole body safe endlinehere  but even now on winter nights when the wind and rain blow from evening on till days dawn i cannot sleep for pain endlinehere  not sleeping for pain is a small thing to bear compared with the joy of being alive when all the rest are dead endlinehere  for otherwise years ago at the ford of lu river my body would have died and my soul hovered by the bones that no one gathered endlinehere  over the graves of ten thousand soldiers mournfully hovering endlinehere  so the old man spoke endlinehere  and i bid you listen to his words have you not heard that the prime minister of kai yan sung kai fu did not reward frontier exploits lest a spirit of aggression should prevail endlinehere  and have you not heard that the prime minister of tien pao yang kuo chung desiring to win imperial favour started a frontier war endlinehere  but long before he could win the war people had lost their temper ask the man with the broken arm in the village of hsin fng endlinehere  white billows and huge waves block the river crossing wherever i go danger and difficulty whatever i do failure endlinehere  just as in my worldly career i wander and lose the road so when i come to the river crossing i am stopped by contrary winds endlinehere  of fishes and prawns sodden in the rain the smell fills my nostrils with the stings of insects that come with the fog my whole body is sore endlinehere  i am growing old time flies and my short span runs out endlinehere  while i sit in a boat at chiu kou wasting ten days endlinehere  i take your poems in my hand and read them beside the candle the poems are finished the candle is low dawn not yet come endlinehere  with sore eyes by the guttering candle still i sit in the dark listening to waves that driven by the wind strike the prow of the ship endlinehere  i have still to travel in my solitary boat three or four leagues by misty waters and rainy sands while the yellow dusk thickens endlinehere  the forest trees are leafless and withered after the mountain rain the roofs of the houses are hidden low among the river mists endlinehere  the horses fed on water grass are too weak to carry their load the cottage walls of wattle and thatch let the wind blow on ones bed endlinehere  in the distance i see red wheeled coaches driving from the town gate they have taken the trouble these civil people to meet their new prefect endlinehere  there is no one among men that has not a special failing and my failing consists in writing verses endlinehere  i have broken away from the thousand ties of life but this infirmity still remains behind endlinehere  and often when i have finished a new poem alone i climb the road to the eastern rock endlinehere  i lean my body on the banks of white stone i pull down with my hands a green cassia branch endlinehere  my mad singing startles the valleys and hills the apes and birds all come to peep endlinehere  fearing to become a laughing stock to the world i choose a place that is unfrequented by men endlinehere  at nine rivers in the tenth year in winter heavy snow the river water covered with ice and the forests broken with their load endlinehere  the birds of the air hungry and cold went flying east and west and with them flew a migrant yen loudly clamouring for food endlinehere  among the snow it pecked for grass and rested on the surface of the ice it tried with its wings to scale the sky but its tired flight was slow endlinehere  the boys of the river spread a net and caught the bird as it flew they took it in their hands to the city market and sold it there alive endlinehere  i that was once a man of the north am now an exile here bird and man in their different kind are each strangers in the south endlinehere  and because the sight of an exiled bird wounded an exiles heart i paid your ransom and set you free and you flew away to the clouds endlinehere  yen yen flying to the clouds tell me whither shall you go endlinehere  the official army and the rebel army have grown old in their opposite trenches the soldiers rations have grown so small theyll be glad of even you endlinehere  the brave boys in their hungry plight will shoot you and eat your flesh they will pluck from your body those long feathers and make them into arrow wings endlinehere  _you_ so bravely splashing reds and blues endlinehere  just when _i_ am getting wrinkled and old endlinehere  why should you waste the moments of inspiration tracing the withered limbs of a sick man endlinehere  tall tall is the palace of chi lin but my deeds have not been frescoed on its walls endlinehere  minutely limned on a foot of painting silk what can i do with a portrait such as _that_ endlinehere  yesterday i heard that such a one was gone this morning they tell me that so and so is dead endlinehere  of friends and acquaintances more than two thirds have suffered change and passed to the land of ghosts endlinehere  those that are gone i shall not see again they alas are for ever finished and done endlinehere  those that are left where are they now endlinehere  they are all scattered a thousand miles away endlinehere  those i have known and loved through all my life on the fingers of my hand how many do i count endlinehere  longing for each other we are all grown gray through the fleeting world rolled like a wave in the stream endlinehere  alas that the feasts and frolics of old days have withered and vanished bringing us to this endlinehere  when shall we meet and drink a cup of wine and laughing gaze into each others eyes endlinehere  up and up the incense burner peak endlinehere  in my heart is stored what my eyes and ears perceived endlinehere  all the year detained by official business to day at last i got a chance to go endlinehere  grasping the creepers i clung to dangerous rocks my hands and feet weary with groping for hold endlinehere  there came with me three or four friends but two friends dared not go further endlinehere  at last we reached the topmost crest of the peak my eyes were blinded my soul rocked and reeled endlinehere  the chasm beneath me ten thousand feet the ground i stood on only a foot wide endlinehere  if you have not exhausted the scope of seeing and hearing how can you realize the wideness of the world endlinehere  the waters of the river looked narrow as a ribbon pn castle smaller than a mans fist endlinehere  how it clings the dust of the worlds halter endlinehere  it chokes my limbs i cannot shake it away endlinehere  thinking of retirement i heaved an envious sigh then with lowered head came back to the ants nest endlinehere  my new province is a land of bamboo groves their shoots in spring fill the valleys and hills endlinehere  the mountain woodman cuts an armful of them and brings them down to sell at the early market endlinehere  things are cheap in proportion as they are common for two farthings i buy a whole bundle endlinehere  i put the shoots in a great earthen pot and heat them up along with boiling rice endlinehere  the purple nodules broken like an old brocade the white skin opened like new pearls endlinehere  now every day i eat them recklessly for a long time i have not touched meat endlinehere  sent as a present from annam a red cockatoo endlinehere  coloured like the peach tree blossom speaking with the speech of men endlinehere  and they did to it what is always done to the learned and eloquent endlinehere  they took a cage with stout bars and shut it up inside endlinehere  after lunch one short nap on waking up two cups of tea endlinehere  raising my head i see the suns light once again slanting to the south west endlinehere  those who are happy regret the shortness of the day those who are sad tire of the years sloth endlinehere  but those whose hearts are devoid of joy or sadness just go on living regardless of short or long endlinehere  above a mountain ten thousand feet high below a river a thousand fathoms deep endlinehere  a strip of green walled by cliffs of stone wide enough for the passage of a single reed endlinehere  long before night the walls are black with dusk without wind white waves rise endlinehere  the big rocks are like a flat sword the little rocks resemble ivory tusks endlinehere  we are stuck fast and cannot move a step endlinehere  how much the less three hundred miles endlinehere  frail and slender the twisted bamboo rope weak the dangerous hold of the towers feet endlinehere  a single slip the whole convoy lost and _my_ life hangs on _this_ thread endlinehere  i have heard a saying he that has an upright heart shall walk scathless through the lands of man and mo endlinehere  how can i believe that since the world began in every shipwreck none have drowned but rogues endlinehere  and how can i born in evil days and fresh from failure ask a kindness of fate endlinehere  often i fear that these un talented limbs will be laid at last in an un named grave endlinehere  suddenly suddenly bearing a stricken heart i left the gates with nothing to comfort me endlinehere  henceforward relegated to deep seclusion in a bottomless gorge flanked by precipitous mountains five months on end the passage of boats is stopped by the piled billows that toss and leap like colts endlinehere  the inhabitants of pa resemble wild apes fierce and lusty they fill the mountains and prairies endlinehere  among such as these i cannot hope for friends and am pleased with anyone who is even remotely human endlinehere  i took money and bought flowering trees and planted them out on the bank to the east of the keep endlinehere  i simply bought whatever had most blooms not caring whether peach apricot or plum endlinehere  a hundred fruits all mixed up together a thousand branches flowering in due rotation endlinehere  each has its season coming early or late but to all alike the fertile soil is kind endlinehere  the red flowers hang like a heavy mist the white flowers gleam like a fall of snow endlinehere  the wandering bees cannot bear to leave them the sweet birds also come there to roost endlinehere  in front there flows an ever running stream beneath there is built a little flat terrace endlinehere  sometimes i sweep the flagstones of the terrace sometimes in the wind i raise my cup and drink endlinehere  the flower branches screen my head from the sun the flower buds fall down into my lap endlinehere  alone drinking alone singing my songs i do not notice that the moon is level with the steps endlinehere  the people of pa do not care for flowers all the spring no one has come to look endlinehere  but their governor general alone with his cup of wine sits till evening and will not move from the place endlinehere  my niece who is six years old is called miss tortoise my daughter of three little summer dress endlinehere  one is beginning to learn to joke and talk the other can already recite poems and songs endlinehere  at morning they play clinging about my feet at night they sleep pillowed against my dress endlinehere  why children did you reach the world so late coming to me just when my years are spent endlinehere  young things draw our feelings to them old people easily give their hearts endlinehere  the sweetest vintage at last turns sour the full moon in the end begins to wane endlinehere  and so with men the bonds of love and affection soon may change to a load of sorrow and care endlinehere  but all the world is bound by loves ties why did i think that i alone should escape endlinehere  trees growing right in front of my window the trees are high and the leaves grow thick endlinehere  the distant mountain view obscured by this dimly shows between endlinehere  one morning i took knife and axe with my own hand i lopped the branches off endlinehere  ten thousand leaves fall about my head a thousand hills came before my eyes endlinehere  suddenly as when clouds or mists break and straight through the blue sky appears again like the face of a friend one has loved seen at last after an age of parting endlinehere  first there came a gentle wind blowing one by one the birds flew back to the tree endlinehere  to ease my mind i gazed to the south east as my eyes wandered my thoughts went far away endlinehere  of men there is none that has not some preference of things there is none but mixes good with ill endlinehere  it was not that i did not love the tender branches but better still to see the green hills endlinehere  i have been ill so long that i do not count the days at the southern window evening and again evening endlinehere  sadly chirping in the grasses under my eaves the winter sparrows morning and evening sing endlinehere  by an effort i rise and lean heavily on my bed tottering i step towards the door of the courtyard endlinehere  by chance i meet a friend who is coming to see me just as if i had gone specially to meet him endlinehere  they took my couch and placed it in the setting sun they spread my rug and i leaned on the balcony pillar endlinehere  tranquil talk was better than any medicine gradually the feelings came back to my numbed heart endlinehere  little sleeping and much grieving the traveller rises at midnight and looks back towards home endlinehere  the sands are bright with moonlight that joins the shores the sail is white with dew that has covered the boat endlinehere  nearing the sea the river grows broader and broader approaching autumn the nights longer and longer endlinehere  thirty times we have slept amid mists and waves and still we have not reached hang chow endlinehere  i grew up at jung yang i was still young when i left endlinehere  on and on forty years passed till again i stayed for the night at jung yang endlinehere  when i went away i was only eleven or twelve this year i am turned fifty six endlinehere  yet thinking back to the times of my childish games whole and undimmed still they rise before me endlinehere  the old houses have all disappeared down in the village none of my people are left endlinehere  it is not only that streets and buildings have changed but steep is level and level changed to steep endlinehere  alone unchanged the waters of chiu and yu passionless flow in their old course endlinehere  while on the road to his new province hang chow in he sends a silver spoon to his niece a kuei whom he had been obliged to leave behind with her nurse old mrs endlinehere  little girls ought to be daintily fed mrs endlinehere  tsao please see to this endlinehere  thats why ive packed and sent a silver spoon you will think of me and eat up your food nicely endlinehere  long ago to a white haired gentleman you made the present of a black gauze hat endlinehere  the gauze hat still sits on my head but you already are gone to the nether springs endlinehere  the thing is old but still fit to wear the man is gone and will never be seen again endlinehere  out on the hill the moon is shining to night and the trees on your tomb are swayed by the autumn wind endlinehere  that so many of the poor should suffer from cold what can we do to prevent endlinehere  to bring warmth to a single body is not much use endlinehere  i wish i had a big rug ten thousand feet long which at one time could cover up every inch of the city endlinehere  our party scattered at yellow dusk and i came home to bed i woke at midnight and went for a walk leaning heavily on a friend endlinehere  as i lay on my pillow my vinous complexion soothed by sleep grew sober in front of the tower the ocean moon accompanying the tide had risen endlinehere  the swallows about to return to the beams went back to roost again the candle at my window just going out suddenly revived its light endlinehere  all the time till dawn came still my thoughts were muddled and in my ears something sounded like the music of flutes and strings endlinehere  _then_ on the shore building sand pagodas _now_ at court covered with tinkling jade endlinehere  this and that equally childish games things whose substance passes in a moment of time endlinehere  while the hands are busy the heart cannot understand when there are no scriptures then doctrine is sound endlinehere  even should one zealously strive to learn the way that very striving will make ones error more endlinehere  all the morning i have lain perversely in bed now at dusk i rise with many yawns endlinehere  my warm stove is quick to get ablaze at the cold mirror i am slow in doing my hair endlinehere  with melted snow i boil fragrant tea seasoned with curds i cook a milk pudding endlinehere  at my sloth and greed there is no one but me to laugh my cheerful vigour none but myself knows endlinehere  the taste of my wine is mild and works no poison the notes of my harp are soft and bring no sadness endlinehere  to the three joys in the book of mencius i have added the fourth of playing with my baby boy endlinehere  i break up cypress and make a book box the box well made and the cypress wood tough endlinehere  in it shall be kept what authors works endlinehere  the inscription says po lo tien endlinehere  all my life has been spent in writing books from when i was young till now that i am old endlinehere  first and last seventy whole volumes big and little three thousand themes endlinehere  all i can do is to divide them among my daughters to be left by them to give to my grandchildren endlinehere  between thirty and forty one is distracted by the five lusts between seventy and eighty one is a prey to a hundred diseases endlinehere  but from fifty to sixty one is free from all ills calm and still the heart enjoys rest endlinehere  i have put behind me love and greed i have done with profit and fame i am still short of illness and decay and far from decrepit age endlinehere  strength of limb i still possess to seek the rivers and hills still my heart has spirit enough to listen to flutes and strings endlinehere  at leisure i open new wine and taste several cups drunken i recall old poems and sing a whole volume endlinehere  hundreds of houses thousands of houses like a chess board endlinehere  the twelve streets like a field planted with rows of cabbage endlinehere  in the distance perceptible dim dim the fire of approaching dawn and a single row of stars lying to the west of the five gates endlinehere  mounting on high i begin to realize the smallness of mans domain gazing into distance i begin to know the vanity of the carnal world endlinehere  i turn my head and hurry home back to the court and market a single grain of rice falling into the great barn endlinehere  two top knots not yet plaited into one endlinehere  of thirty years just beyond half endlinehere  you who are really a lady of silks and satins are now become my hill and stream companion endlinehere  at the spring fountains together we splash and play on the lovely trees together we climb and sport endlinehere  her cheeks grow rosy as she quickens her sleeve dancing her brows grow sad as she slows her songs tune endlinehere  dont go singing the song of the willow branches when theres no one here with a heart for you to break endlinehere  at night you came and took my hand and we wandered together in my dream when i woke in the morning there was no one to stop the tears that fell on my handkerchief endlinehere  on the banks of the chang my aged body three times has passed through sickness at hsien yang to the grasses on your grave eight times has autumn come endlinehere  you lie buried beneath the springs and your bones are mingled with the clay endlinehere  i lodging in the world of men my hair white as snow endlinehere  a wei and han lang both followed in their turn among the shadows of the terrace of night did you know them or not endlinehere  at night in my dream i stoutly climbed a mountain endlinehere  going out alone with my staff of holly wood endlinehere  a thousand crags a hundred hundred valleys in my dream journey none were unexplored and all the while my feet never grew tired and my step was as strong as in my young days endlinehere  can it be that when the mind travels backward the body also returns to its old state endlinehere  and can it be as between body and soul that the body may languish while the soul is still strong endlinehere  soul and body both are vanities dreaming and waking both alike unreal endlinehere  in the day my feet are palsied and tottering in the night my steps go striding over the hills endlinehere  as day and night are divided in equal parts between the two i _get_ as much as i _lose_ endlinehere  congratulating himself on the comforts of his life after his retirement from office endlinehere  lined coat warm cap and easy felt slippers in the little tower at the low window sitting over the sunken brazier endlinehere  body at rest heart at peace no need to rise early endlinehere  i wonder if the courtiers at the western capital know of these things or not endlinehere  no new poems his brush will trace even his fame is dead endlinehere  his old poems are deep in dust at the bottom of boxes and cupboards endlinehere  once lately when someone was singing suddenly i heard a verse before i had time to catch the words a pain had stabbed my heart endlinehere  those who speak know nothing those who know are silent endlinehere  these words as i am told were spoken by lao tz endlinehere  if we are to believe that lao tz was himself _one who knew_ how comes it that he wrote a book of five thousand words endlinehere  chuang tz levels all things and reduces them to the same monad endlinehere  but _i_ say that even in their sameness difference may be found endlinehere  a traveller came from across the seas telling of strange sights endlinehere  in a deep fold of the sea hills i saw a terrace and tower endlinehere  in the midst there stood a fairy temple with one niche empty endlinehere  they all told me this was waiting for lo tien to come endlinehere  traveller i have studied the empty gate i am no disciple of fairies the story you have just told is nothing but an idle tale endlinehere  the hills of ocean shall never be lo tiens home endlinehere  when i leave the earth it will be to go to the heaven of bliss fulfilled endlinehere  they have put my bed beside the unpainted screen they have shifted my stove in front of the blue curtain endlinehere  i listen to my grandchildren reading me a book i watch the servants heating up my soup endlinehere  with rapid pencil i answer the poems of friends i feel in my pockets and pull out medicine money endlinehere  when this superintendence of trifling affairs is done i lie back on my pillows and sleep with my face to the south endlinehere  the end chiswick press printed by charles whittingham and co endlinehere  tooks court chancery lane london endlinehere  heading for biographical read bibliographical endlinehere  you stand here at my side good priapus albeit from thieves ive nothing to fear endlinehere  freely pluck whosoever would eat endlinehere  hypocrites those are the ones endlinehere  tell me ye stones and give me o glorious palaces answer endlinehere  speak o ye streets but one word endlinehere  genius art thou alive endlinehere  yes here within thy sanctified walls theres a soul in each object roma eternal endlinehere  for me only are all things yet mute endlinehere  who will then tell me in whispers and where must i find just the window where one day shell be glimpsed creature wholl scorch me with love endlinehere  cant i divine yet the paths through which over and over to her and from her ill go squandering valuable time endlinehere  visiting churches and palaces all of the ruins and the pillars i a responsible man profit from making this trip endlinehere  with my business accomplished ah then shall only one temple amors temple alone take the initiate in endlinehere  rome thou art a whole world it is true and yet without love this world would not be the world rome would cease to be rome endlinehere  more than ever i dreamed i have found it my happy good fortune endlinehere  cupid sagaciously led past those palazzos so fine endlinehere  he of course knows very well and i have also discovered what beneath tapestries rich gilded boudoirs conceal endlinehere  one may if one wishes call him a blind wanton boy but i know you clever cupid too well endlinehere  o incorruptible god endlinehere  here he provides me with evrything sees that i get what i call for each day that passes he spreads freshly plucked roses for me endlinehere  isnt that heaven on earth endlinehere  say beautiful lady borghese what would you give to me more endlinehere  banquets and game tables operas balls promenades down the corso endlinehere  these but deprive my sweet boy of his most opportune times endlinehere  finery haughtiness do not entice me endlinehere  does one not lift a gown of the finest brocade just as one lifts common wool endlinehere  if shes to press in comfort a lover against that soft bosom doesnt he want her to be free from all brooches and chains endlinehere  must not the jewelry and then the lace and the bustles and whalebone all of it come off entire if hes to learn how she feels endlinehere  i encounter no troubles like those endlinehere  simple dress of rough homespun at but a lovers mere touch tumbles in folds to the floor endlinehere  quickly he carries the girl as shes clad in chemise of coarse linen just as a nursemaid might playfully up to her bed endlinehere  drapings of satin are absent the mattress is quite unembroidered endlinehere  large is this room where the bed offers its comfort for two endlinehere  jupiters welcome to more from his juno if he can get it let any mortal find rest softer wherever he can endlinehere  we are content with cupids delights authentic and naked and with the exquisite creak crack of the bed as it rocks endlinehere  ask whomever you will but youll never find out where im lodging high societys lords ladies so groomed and refined endlinehere  tell me was werther authentic endlinehere  did all of that happen in real life endlinehere  lotte oh where did she live werthers only true love endlinehere  how many times have i cursed those frivolous pages that broadcast out among all mankind passions i felt in my youth endlinehere  were he my brother why then i d have murdered poor werther endlinehere  yet his despondent ghost couldnt have sought worse revenge endlinehere  do not beloved regret that you yielded to me so quickly i entertain no base insolent thoughts about you endlinehere  arrows of cupid work divers effects endlinehere  some do but scratch us slow and insidious these poison our hearts over years endlinehere  yet with a head freshly honed and cunningly fledged certain others pierce to the marrow inflame rapidly there our blood endlinehere  when gods and goddesses in days of heroes made love then lust followed look and desire with no delay was indulged endlinehere  surely you dont think the goddess of love lost a moment reflecting when in idean grove anchises caught her eye endlinehere  nor did luna delay about kissing that beautiful dreamer jealous aurora had else hastily wakened the lad endlinehere  at the loud banquet hero regarded leander then promptly into dark waters he plunged ardently swam toward his love endlinehere  today a proud rome claims to be queen of the world endlinehere  we are so pious we lovers endlinehere  discreetly we worship all powers hoping for favor from each god and each goddess as well endlinehere  therefore we gladly confess to singling a special immortal and our devotions each day pledging but solely to her endlinehere  mischievous celebrants we at these mysteries gay and so solemn silence exactly befits rites at which were adepts endlinehere  sweet opportunity that is her name endlinehere  you should meet her endlinehere  often will she turn up ever in a new form endlinehere  daughter of proteus might well she be whom he sired upon thetis endlinehere  in metamorphoses theyve many a hero deceived endlinehere  so now the daughter beguiles the naive and bedazzles the foolish teases you while youre asleep when you awaken shes flown endlinehere  eagerly yields herself up to the quick to the active man only endlinehere  he discovers shes tame playful and tender and sweet endlinehere  once she appeared to me too a dark skinned girl tumbling over her forehead the hair down in waves heavy and dark endlinehere  round about a delicate neck curled short little ringlets up from the crown of her head crinkled the unbraided hair endlinehere  when she dashed by me i seized her mistaking her not endlinehere  lovingly kiss and embrace she returned knowing and teaching me how endlinehere  o how enraptured i was endlinehere  ah say now no more endlinehere  its a bygone endlinehere  but o pigtails of rome still im entrammled in you endlinehere  happily now on classical soil i feel inspiration endlinehere  voices from present and past speak here evocatively endlinehere  heeding ancient advice i leaf through the works of the ancients with an assiduous hand endlinehere  daily the pleasures renewed endlinehere  throughout the night in a different way im kept busy by cupid if erudition is halved rapture is doubled that way endlinehere  do then i not become wise when i trace with my eye her sweet bosoms form and the line of her hips stroke with my hand endlinehere  i acquire as i reflect and compare my first understanding of marble see with an eye that feels feel with a hand that sees endlinehere  while my beloved i grant it deprives me of moments of daylight she in the nighttime hours gives compensation in full endlinehere  and we do more than just kiss we prosecute reasoned discussions should she succumb to sleep that gives me time for my thoughts endlinehere  in her embrace its by no means unusual ive composed poems and the hexameters beat gently tapped out on her back fingertips counting in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber endlinehere  air from deep in her breast penetrates mine and there burns endlinehere  cupid while stirring the flame in our lamp no doubt thinks of those days when for the triumvirs he similar service performed endlinehere  can you be cruel enough to sadden me thus with reproaches endlinehere  germans speak i suppose bitterly when theyre in love endlinehere  bear it i must when the gossips bring forth accusations im guilty or am i not endlinehere  but alas all of my guilt was with you endlinehere  clothes that youve given bear witness for envious neighbors that the poor widow no more grieves for her husband alone endlinehere  did you not thoughtlessly visit me in the disguise of a cleric muffled all up in a cloak hair all rounded behind endlinehere  who was it chose that gray monk if not you endlinehere  well then a prelate now is my lover ah who is my prelate but you endlinehere  never incredible as it may sound in this clerical city has any cleric brought me swear it i will to his bed endlinehere  i was sufficiently poor sad to say endlinehere  the seducers noted it well endlinehere  falconier ogled me often enough endlinehere  one of the pimps for albani with billets doux very impressive called me to ostia once endlinehere  quattro fontani next time endlinehere  who was it did not appear there endlinehere  why who but the very same girl who hated with all of her heart stockings both violet and red endlinehere  for in the end you poor girls are the ones who are sure to be cheated endlinehere  so said my father although mother was not much impressed endlinehere  father was right endlinehere  here i stand in the end being cheated and scolded endlinehere  you dont believe your own words endlinehere  theyre your excuse to escape endlinehere  unworthy of women are men endlinehere  we who carry your children next to our hearts in these hearts loyalty we bear you too endlinehere  as for you men when youve poured out your potency in our embraces and your desires dissipate love with them passes away endlinehere  these things expressed and taking her child from its chair my beloved presses it close to her heart kisses it tears in her eyes endlinehere  im now so very ashamed of myself for having permitted gossip of neighbors to spoil picture so eloquent endlinehere  for a short moment a fire may burn darkly while smoke swirls about it endlinehere  water dashed on the coals suddenly smothers their glow endlinehere  rapidly then renewed heat overcomes those lowering vapors sends up a flame that anew bright and more powerful gleams endlinehere  how very happy i am here in rome when i think of the bad days far back there in the north wrapped in a grayish light endlinehere  over my head there the heavens weighed down so dismal and gloomy colorless formless that world round this exhausted man lay endlinehere  seeking myself in myself an unsatisfied spirit i brooded spying out pathways dark lost in dreary reflection endlinehere  phoebus the god evokes forms clear are his colors by day endlinehere  bright with the stars comes the evening ringing with songs that are tender and the glow of the moon brighter than northern sun endlinehere  what blessedness mortals may know endlinehere  am i now dreaming endlinehere  or welcomes jupiter father as guest me to ambrosial halls endlinehere  see i lie here extending my arms toward your knees endlinehere  i am praying hospitalitys god jupiter xenius endlinehere  hear how i am come to this place i no longer can say i was seized up by hebe endlinehere  twas she led to this sacred hill endlinehere  did you command her a hero to seek and deliver before you endlinehere  may be she erred endlinehere  let her mistake profit me endlinehere  does not fortuna your daughter when strewing her glorious presents after the manner of girls yield to each passing whim endlinehere  you o hospitable god will by no means now banish a stranger from your olympian heights back to the base earth again endlinehere  forgive me jupiter is not romes capitoline hill second olympus to you endlinehere  suffer me jupiter here and let hermes guide me at last then past cestius tomb gently to orkus below endlinehere  when you were small you say neither did others consider you f air nor even your mother find praise and i believe it till you grew bigger developing quietly over the years endlinehere  i picture you to myself as an unusual child endlinehere  also the blossoms on grapevines are wanting in shape and in color although the fruit when its ripe pleases both mankind and gods endlinehere  kindling autumnal fire in a rustic convivial fireplace how the sticks crackle and spew flames and glittering sparks endlinehere  strikes me especially pleasant this evening endlinehere  then in the morning officious shell leave the bed of her lover rouse adroitly the flames out from their ashes anew endlinehere  cupid has lent to her above others the gift of cajoling up from the ashes desire just when slumbers begun endlinehere  therefore ye living rejoice that love keeps you warm for a while yet until cold lethe anoints captures your foot in its flight endlinehere  they are for you o ye graces just a few leaves by a poet onto your pure altar laid buds of the rose beside offered in confidence endlinehere  but its to bacchus the sensuous dreamer cythera sends glances bathed in sweetest desire even in marble theyre damp endlinehere  thinking about his embrace and its pleasures she seems to be asking shouldnt our glorious son here at our side stand erect endlinehere  cant you hear voices beloved out on the via flamina endlinehere  reapers are now going home back from harvesting grain endlinehere  they had journeyed to rome from afar and here plaited for ceres wreaths which the romans today scorn to make for themselves endlinehere  festivals no longer celebrate ceres the nourishing goddess who replaced acorns of old giving man golden wheat endlinehere  let us commemorate her then ourselves in festival private two constitute a whole tribe when they are two in love endlinehere  have you by any chance heard how that mystical strange celebration followed victorious troops back from eleusis to rome endlinehere  greeks were the ones who began it and only to greeks they proclaimed it even within roman walls come to the sanctified night endlinehere  those who were not of the cult kept their distance neophytes trembled waiting in garments of white symbol of all that is pure endlinehere  then the initiates must aimlessly wander about through the eerie circles of figures as if pilgriming through their own dreams endlinehere  snakes on the ground were writhing about endlinehere  surely the gestures of murmuring priests must contain some deep meaning impatient acolytes wait anxiously hoping for light endlinehere  not until after many a testing and trial did they discover what within sacred ring secretive image concealed endlinehere  what was this mystery other than this that demeter goddess once upon a time had to a hero been kind endlinehere  it was to jason powerful king of the cretans she granted of her immortal self hidden sweet parts to explore endlinehere  that made the fortune of crete endlinehere  the marital bed of the goddess soon grew pregnant with grain heavy her bounteous fields endlinehere  as for the rest of the world it languished away while ceres derelict of her true task dalliance offered in love endlinehere  now the initiate youths having followed this tale all astonished turned and beckoned their loves love do you comprehend endlinehere  see there the sacred shade beneath that bushy boughed myrtle endlinehere  our satisfaction will there scarcely endanger a world endlinehere  cupid is always a scoundrel and if you believe him hell cheat you endlinehere  heres what the hypocrite said trust me just once more this time endlinehere  i have the best of intentions toward you who have now dedicated i recognize it with thanks life and writings to me endlinehere  lo i have followed you hither to rome and id like to do something here in this far away land pleasing to such an old friend endlinehere  every traveller ive ever known has complained of poor treatment he whom i recommend treatment delicious receives endlinehere  how youve revered the formative will of those ancient artists endlinehere  in their own ateliers often i ve visited them endlinehere  as for their works why i formed those myself now this time im boasting not endlinehere  oh come now admit what i am saying is true endlinehere  where are your own creations your service to me having slackened endlinehere  where is inventions glow now endlinehere  where is the color all gone endlinehere  friend do you hope you can create again endlinehere  the school of the ancients yet remains open endlinehere  its gates years have not closed them to you endlinehere  i am eternally young and as teacher i still love the young ones endlinehere  wisdom that comes with old age pleases me not endlinehere  listen here wasnt antiquity young when those fortunate ancients were living endlinehere  happy then be your life too in it antiquity lives endlinehere  where will you find a fit theme for your song endlinehere  it is i must provide it endlinehere  as for a style truly grand love can alone give you that endlinehere  all of these claims that sophist asserted endlinehere  could i contradict him endlinehere  i am wont to obey when my commander decrees endlinehere  treacherous now he is keeping his word giving me themes for my poems while he is stealing my time potency presence of mind endlinehere  gazing into her eyes holding hands giving kisses exchanging syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand murmuring our conversations we stutter in sweet oratory endlinehere  hymns of such sort pass away wanting prosodical tact endlinehere  goddess of morning aurora as friend of my muse i once knew you endlinehere  has the unprincipled god cupid seduced you now too endlinehere  so that these mornings you come as his sweetheart awakening me at his festive altar again where i must celebrate him endlinehere  here on my breast flows her hair an abundance of curls while her head rests pressing my arm as its bent so as to pillow her neck endlinehere  love in our hearts makes us one as the genuine need there stays constant only returning desire knows oscillation or change endlinehere  gently her hand presses mine now she opens her eyes and is looking into my own eyes endlinehere  let my thoughts rest on your form endlinehere  please close your eyes endlinehere  theyre inebriation confusion they rob me all too soon of the joy quiet reflection affords endlinehere  grand are the forms of this body and nobly positioned each member endlinehere  had ariadne lain thus theseus never had fled endlinehere  only a single kiss for these lips and then o theseus leave her look at her eyes shes awake endlinehere  now youre eternally bound endlinehere  boy wont you light me a lamp endlinehere  but dear master theres light in the sky yet endlinehere  dont waste your oil and the wick endlinehere  dont close the shutters so soon endlinehere  only the houses are blocking the sun there its not yet the mountains endlinehere  until the curfew shall ring full half an hour must pass endlinehere  wretched young fellow be gone and obey me endlinehere  my loved one is coming endlinehere  lamplight console me till then harbinger warm of the night endlinehere  poets of old in chorus cried out against those two serpents making them horrible names hated in all of the world python the one the other the hydra of lerna endlinehere  these monsters both have now been destroyed thanks to the deeds of the gods endlinehere  fire breathing venomous once they no longer now depredate our flocks and meadows and woods fields of golden grain endlinehere  how is it then that some spiteful god in his wrath has raised from the poisonous slime offspring so monstrous again endlinehere  theres an insidious viper creeps into the loveliest gardens lying in wait to attack all who seek pleasure therein endlinehere  noble hesperian dragon i call you courageous and forthright endlinehere  boldly defending your own beautiful apples of gold endlinehere  as for this worm why he is not guarding at all for his presence sullies both garden and fruit till they deserve no defense endlinehere  happy lucretius knew how in his day to forego love completely fearing not to enjoy pleasure in anyones arms endlinehere  fortunate ancient propertius for you a slave fetched the girls down from the aventine hill from tarpeias grove endlinehere  cynthia then when driving you out of such unchaste embraces found you unfaithful its true but she did find you whole endlinehere  who would today dare attempt to escape from fidelitys ennui endlinehere  love does not hold one back only concern for ones health endlinehere  even the woman we love may afford us uncertain enjoyment nowhere can feminine lap safely encouch a mans head endlinehere  matrimonial beds insecure and sos fornication husband lover and wife pass to each other the hurt endlinehere  think of those ages of gold when jupiter followed his urges chose callisto one day turned to semel the next endlinehere  it was important to him to find thresholds of temples so sacred pure when enamoured he sought powerful entry to them endlinehere  can you imagine the ragings of juno if in loves skirmish poisonous weapons on her by her own spouse had been turned endlinehere  but we neo pagans may not after all be abandoned entirely yet there is speeding a god mercifully over the earth quick and assiduous endlinehere  everyone knows him and ought to adore him herald of zeus hermes the healing god endlinehere  cupid will hold out his hand o and entrusting myself to the rascal i beg you please may i do so in pleasure with no danger or worry or fear endlinehere  i cannot think id have gone with julius caesar to britain to the popina right here florus would tug me with ease endlinehere  fogs of the dreary north remain a more baleful remembrance than in the kitchens of rome tribes of assiduous fleas endlinehere  after today ill remember you even more kindly tavernas you osterias as you are called aptly by those here in rome endlinehere  that was the place i encountered my mistress today with the uncle whom she so often deceives so that she can have me endlinehere  she is of course well aware that i am watching so finally makes the v of the roman five with a virgule before endlinehere  quickly as soon as ive seen she interlaces the circles reducing them all to ornatest patterns but still the sweet iv stood as engraved in my eye endlinehere  i sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost bloody half from delight at the ruse partly from stifled desire such a long time until dark then another four hours of waiting endlinehere  sun who tarries on high contemplating rome greater never youve nor shall you in future see greater than rome o sun as your priest horace enraptured foretold endlinehere  tarry no longer today endlinehere  go seek other realms beneath heaven endlinehere  sooner depart and leave romes seven famed hills to me endlinehere  please do the poet a favor and shorten the glorious hours which the painter devours eagerly filling his eyes endlinehere  then hastily plunge to the ocean endlinehere  first were but few simple dwellings here suddenly sunlight discovered nations enlivening hills teeming with fortunate thieves endlinehere  onto this spot they assembled such plunder in your eye so splendid all earths remaining orb scarcely was worthy of note endlinehere  you watched a world being born here watched the same world sink to ruin and from those ruins yet arise world again greater perhaps endlinehere  o may i long by your light now behold this rome endlinehere  o but come rushing the moment my love designated so sweetly endlinehere  no but i heard at least three endlinehere  thus my dear muses again youve beguiled the monotony for me endlinehere  of this long interval while i was apart from my love endlinehere  all of you now farewell endlinehere  ill be going now dont be offended endlinehere  for though youre proud youll concede cupid in my heart comes first endlinehere  why did you fail to appear at the cot in the vineyard today love endlinehere  as i had promised i would long i awaited you there endlinehere  dear i had almost arrived when i saw by good fortune your uncle standing right there by the vines looking now this way now that endlinehere  stealthily i slipped away endlinehere  you saw the scarecrow thats all endlinehere  nothing else drove you away endlinehere  reeds and some discarded garments all hastily cobbled together i helped to make it myself diligent in my own grief endlinehere  well now his wish is fulfilled endlinehere  the old gardners most dissolute crow has left on this day unscathed nice little garden and niece endlinehere  while there is many an unpleasant sound i hate to hear barking worse than anything else endlinehere  bellowing dogs split my ears endlinehere  nevertheless i do like to hear and take pleasure in listening to the loud howl of the dog raised from a pup next door endlinehere  that is the dog that so bayed one time at my girl that he almost gave our secret away when she was visiting me endlinehere  now when i hear the dog barking i think my beloved is coming or i remember the time when long awaited she came endlinehere  i can tell not only about a discomfort far greater than others but of a horror besides thinking of which will arouse every fiber in me to revulsion endlinehere  my friends i confess it great displeasure i take lying alone in my bed endlinehere  thats why faustina as my companion in bed makes me happy loving she always remains faithful as i am to her endlinehere  young men are aroused in their passions by obstacles and by excitement i prefer to go slow savoring pleasures secure endlinehere  is it not bliss to exchange tender kisses containing no dangers sucking into our lungs carefree our partners own life endlinehere  that is the way our long nights of enjoyment are passed endlinehere  we listen breast against breast to the storm pouring down rain in the wind morning begins to dawn we expect from these hours approaching blossoms that will adorn festive the coming new day endlinehere  quirites permit me the joy and may this of all pleasures on earth the first and the last be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god endlinehere  ah to uphold ones respectable name is not easy endlinehere  the lady fame has an ancient foe cupid my master and lord endlinehere  oh by the way have you heard of the cause of their mutual hatred endlinehere  its an old story i think let me just tell it again endlinehere  powerful ever the goddess but nevertheless to her fellows overbearing and rude quite unendurable endlinehere  she had by the gods since time out of mind at their banquets been dreaded yelling with brassiest voice orders to great and to small endlinehere  once in her arrogance even maintained that she had subjected to her own will as her slave joves most illustrious son endlinehere  one of these days o father of deities cried she in triumph i shall be bringing you my hercules as if new born endlinehere  dont think that hercules be still that boy whom alcmene once bore you his adulation of me makes him now god upon earth endlinehere  when toward olympus he gazes ive no doubt you hope that hes looking piously toward your knees endlinehere  hes looking for me endlinehere  o the vision of winning my favor makes easy hitherto unexplored paths under that powerful foot endlinehere  i do my part for i meet him halfway and proclaim his adventures praising his name in advance even before hes begun endlinehere  one day youll wed me to hercules endlinehere  hero who amazons conquered that day will overwhelm me endlinehere  happily ill call him spouse endlinehere  all of the gods kept their counsel and none would reply to the braggart lest in a pique she devise vengeance against one of them endlinehere  scene now completed and ready to tease he goes scampering shouting for all olympus to hear come see these glorious deeds endlinehere  heaven and earth and the sun on his indefatigable journey over that infinite path never did witness the like endlinehere  everyone hastened gulled by the dissolute boy who feigning earnest had summoned them all fame by no means lagged behind endlinehere  which of the gods will now smile in sweet condescension on cupid endlinehere  delighted of course seeing a man humbled so endlinehere  fame on the other hand stood there ashamed embarrassed despairing endlinehere  first she just laughed saying gods be not deceived endlinehere  its a masque endlinehere  i know my hero too well to be fooled by disguises of actors endlinehere  soon though in pain she perceived hercules none but he endlinehere  how those boys bacchus and mercury guffawed and freely admitted sweet must be the repose lying on bosom so fine of this magnificent woman endlinehere  they turned to vulcan entreating do not release them just yet endlinehere  let us inspect them once more endlinehere  and the old cuckold was cuckold enough to comply with their wishes endlinehere  as for poor fame in all haste burning with wrath she must flee endlinehere  since then no armistice has been proclaimed to the feuding between them endlinehere  let her but favor a man hot in pursuit is the boy endlinehere  he whom fame honors most can least defend against cupid and her most dangrous attacks strike the most morally proud endlinehere  whoever tries to escape him is dragged down from bad deeds to worse ones endlinehere  yes he will offer you girls if like a fool you despise these only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious heat of mans love for man ardent desires toward beasts endlinehere  for those ashamed of him cupid reserves the bitterest passions mingling for hypocrites their pleasure in vice and remorse endlinehere  but at the same time the goddess seeks him shes watching and listning endlinehere  should find him with you ill disposed will she be frighten you frowning austerely contemptuously violently casting into the worst of repute houses hes known to frequent endlinehere  ah its the same with me too endlinehere  i havent escaped her the goddess endlinehere  jealously she seeks me out sweet secret love to expose endlinehere  i will submit to the ancient law and in silence revere her for when great lords fall out i like the greeks must atone endlinehere  however comely be strength or free and undaunted comportment secrecy is for a man most important of all endlinehere  mighty subduer of cities discretion o princess of nations goddess whom i adore safely youve led me thus far endlinehere  now though what fate shall befall me endlinehere  my frivolous muse has now opened cupid the scamp opens lips hitherto sealed so well endlinehere  difficult is it alas to conceal the shame of a monarch hide it can neither his crown nor a tight phrygian cap midas has asses ears endlinehere  the first servant discovers o horror endlinehere  shame of this secret so weighs midas unburdens his heart endlinehere  into the earth for safekeeping the servant must bury the story easing in this way the king earth must conceal the tale endlinehere  reeds in a trice are sprouting and rustling in murmuring breezes midas o midas the king bears the ears of an ass endlinehere  mine is a secret more pleasant but even more difficult keeping out of abundance of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth endlinehere  none of my ladyfriends dare i confide in for they would but chide me nor any gentleman friend lest he be rival to me endlinehere  rapture proclaim to the grove to the echoing cliffs perorate it endlinehere  one can do that if ones young or if ones lonely enough endlinehere  i to hexameters tell in pentameters i will confide it during the day she was joy happiness all the night long endlinehere  shes coming and must not be seen by the neighbor endlinehere  breezes rustle the leaves muffle the sound of her feet endlinehere  and as for you little poems o grow and flower your blossoms cradling themselves in the air tepid and soft with loves breath endlinehere  wafting betray to quirites as midas reeds did with cheap gossip one happy couple in love and their sweet secret at last endlinehere  i in the back of the garden the last of the gods in a corner ineptly formed must i stand endlinehere  evil the inroads of time endlinehere  cucumber vines grow entwining about this primeval lingam cracking it almost in two under the weight of the fruit endlinehere  faggots are heaped all about me against the cold of the winter which i so hate for the crows settling then down on my head which they befoul very shamefully endlinehere  summers no better the servants empty their bowels and show insolent naked behinds endlinehere  filth above and below endlinehere  i was clearly in danger of turning into filth myself toadstool rotten wood endlinehere  now by your efforts o noblest of artists i shall recover with fellow gods my just place endlinehere  and its no more than my due endlinehere  jupiters throne so dishonestly won it was i who secured it color and ivory marble and bronze not to mention the poems endlinehere  now all intelligent men look upon me in kindness endlinehere  they like to form their own image of me just as the poet has done endlinehere  nor do the girls take offense when they see me by no means the matrons endlinehere  none finds me ugly today though i am monstrously strong endlinehere
